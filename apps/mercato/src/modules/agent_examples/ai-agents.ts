// `support.ticket_triage` is a fully self-contained example agent declared in a
// NEW app module (`agent_examples`). It shows the minimum needed to ship an
// Agent Orchestrator agent from any module:
//   1. a Zod result schema in data/validators.ts,
//   2. a defineAgent(...) call in this file,
//   3. registering the module in apps/mercato/src/modules.ts,
//   4. `yarn generate`.
//
// It is RESEARCHER (returns data, proposes nothing) and uses NO tools — it
// reasons purely over the input it is given. The agent appears in
// Backend → Agents and can be run from the Playground with input like:
//   { "subject": "Charged twice this month", "body": "I see two charges ..." }
