/**
 * Cross-module entity link declared by the example module.
 *
 * `ExampleCustomerPriority` adds a priority to a customer record without an ORM
 * relationship to `customers` — the ban on cross-module relations means the link
 * is a plain `customer_id` uuid column plus this declaration, which is what the
 * generators and the data engine traverse.
 *
 * `table` is declared, not required: the query engine derives the extension table
 * with the same regular pluralizer it uses everywhere else, so it would also reach
 * `example_customer_priorities` from `example_customer_priority`. The declaration
 * is the explicit form — it demonstrates the escape hatch a module needs when its
 * `@Entity({ tableName })` does not match the derived name (`person` → `people`),
 * and `__tests__/entity-extensions.test.ts` pins it to the physical schema in
 * `migrations/.snapshot-open-mercato.json`.
 *
 * NOTE — declaration-only extension point. Nothing in this module (or in the
 * platform) passes `includeExtensions` to a query at runtime, and doing so would
 * not surface this data today: the basic query engine's extension join adds no
 * projection and exposes no filterable/sortable alias, and the hybrid engine that
 * DI actually registers ignores the flag outside its basic-engine fallback. The
 * declaration is still the live contract — it is what `yarn generate` emits into
 * the module registry as `entityExtensions`.
