# Push Notifications and Devices Modules

**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Author:** Jacek Tomaszewski (`@jtomaszewski`)
**Status:** Implemented — Phases 1–8. Ships as a single PR against `develop`.
**Related:** `packages/core/src/modules/notifications/` (in-app notifications, #412); `#539` (security/MFA — future device-trust consumer); upstream PR #2595 (superseded, devices-only)
**Companion specs:** [`2026-07-01-push-delivery-e2e-findings.md`](2026-07-01-push-delivery-e2e-findings.md) (org-propagation blockers found during e2e), [`2026-07-03-push-channels-tenant-scope.md`](2026-07-03-push-channels-tenant-scope.md) (tenant-wide push channels)

## TLDR

**Key Points:**
- Open Mercato ships only **in-app** notifications. There is no mobile push channel, no device registry, no DB-persistent notification type registry, and no per-channel user preferences.
- This spec adds two core modules (`devices`, `push_notifications`), extends `notifications` with a type catalogue + channel-agnostic preferences, and delivers push **through the existing `communication_channels` hub** — FCM, APNs, and Expo are hub `ChannelAdapter`s in their own npm packages.

**Scope:**
- `devices` — generic per-tenant `(user, device, platform)` registry. Push is one consumer; MFA device-trust (#539), session-aware auth, and audit logs are plausible future consumers.
- `notifications` extensions — DB-backed type registry, per-`(user, type, channel)` preferences, and a single delivery gate that every channel obeys.
- `push_notifications` — delivery log, delivery strategy, retry/reclaim worker.
- `packages/channel-{fcm,apns,expo}` — hub `ChannelAdapter` packages holding all provider-specific code.

**Concerns:**
- Push tokens are secrets. They are encrypted at rest and must never reach a list/detail response, an audit snapshot, a mutation-guard payload, or a provider response.
- The delivery queue is at-least-once. Exactly-once *send* is enforced by an atomic `pending → sending` claim, not by the queue.
- No fake validates conformance with the real providers. Only live credentials do; that gap is stated deliberately and is not closed by any option considered.

## Overview

An Open Mercato app that wants mobile push must today build a device-token store, a delivery strategy, an FCM/APNs sender, a client-readable type registry, per-channel preference toggles, and a retrying worker. That is a lot of infrastructure, and it is the same in every app.

This spec splits the work along channel-agnostic vs. channel-specific lines:

- **Channel-agnostic** (existing `notifications` module): type registry, preferences, the `shouldDeliver` gate. Future email/SMS channels read the same tables.
- **Channel-specific** (new `push_notifications` module): delivery rows, fan-out, worker.
- **Provider-specific** (new `channel-*` packages): the FCM/APNs/Expo SDKs and their message builders.
- **Cross-cutting** (new `devices` module): device identity, reusable beyond push.

> **Design stance**: a delivery log with an exponential-backoff worker and `unregistered`-token device cleanup; separate modules along the channel-agnostic/channel-specific seam rather than one combined module; one preference row per `(user, type, channel)` rather than per-channel boolean columns; devices registrable without a token; and the push token treated as a hard secret — encrypted at rest and never returned; only the delivery *log* keeps a last-8 snapshot. See § Alternatives Considered.

## Problem Statement

### Gaps in the current `notifications` module

- `NotificationTypeDefinition` is **in-memory only**. A mobile app cannot enumerate types via API to render a preferences screen — it would have to ship a copy of the catalogue.
- There are no **per-channel user preferences**. `Notification.channels` is fixed at creation time and purely descriptive; users cannot opt out per type.
- There is no **mobile push** delivery strategy.
- There is no **device registry** — no first-class `(user, device, platform)` entity, no lifecycle, no platform metadata.

### The channels that bypass the seam get no enforcement

The `NotificationDeliveryStrategy` seam is correct, but on `develop` the two pre-existing channels do not use it: **in-app** delivery was the implicit act of writing the `Notification` row, and **email** was hard-coded inline in the dispatch subscriber. Because per-channel enforcement lives *inside each strategy*, disabling `in_app` or `email` for a type silently still delivers it, and the `nonOptOut`/`silent` governance flags would be honored on push only.

## Proposed Solution

### Module 1 — `devices` (new, in `@open-mercato/core`)

Generic device registry owning `(tenant, org, user, device)` identity and lifecycle.

Device identity **includes the organization**: a device registered in a different org is a different row. The partial unique index is declared `NULLS NOT DISTINCT` (Postgres 15+), because Postgres otherwise treats NULLs as distinct and null-org rows would stop deduping. "Active" means `deleted_at IS NULL`; push delivery additionally requires a non-null `push_token`.

**`push_token` is a hard secret.** It is encrypted at rest (`devices/encryption.ts` → `findWithDecryption`/`findOneWithDecryption` at every read site), never returned by any list/detail response (only `push_provider` and `push_token_updated_at` are exposed), redacted to `'[redacted]'` from the command snapshots the audit log persists (and therefore from the derived `changesJson` exposed via `audit_logs.view_self`), and stripped from the mutation-guard payload so it cannot surface in enterprise record-lock conflict details. The real token survives only in the internal undo payload, which no API exposes, so register/update/deactivate stay undoable.

APIs split into self-serve and admin trees, matching the `customer_accounts` / `staff` convention. The **list** routes are org-scoped through the standard `orgField: 'organizationId'` rather than a hand-rolled narrowing — the query engine's `resolveOrganizationScope` is null-aware, so a nullable column does not hide rows from unrestricted admins. The per-id routes dispatch commands rather than going through `makeCrudRoute`, so they narrow explicitly: self-serve filters the `findOne` by tenant + active org, and the admin tree loads tenant-scoped then gates on `isOrganizationReadAccessAllowed` to return 403.

- **Self-serve** (`devices.view` / `devices.manage`): `POST /api/devices` (idempotent upsert of the caller's own device, revives a soft-deleted row), `GET /api/devices`, `PUT /api/devices/:id` (owner-only), `DELETE /api/devices/:id` (owner-only soft-delete).
- **Admin** (`devices.admin`, under `api/admin/devices`): list/create/read/update/deactivate any in-scope device; 403 outside the admin's org scope.

`last_seen_at` advances **only** when the client explicitly sends `lastSeenAt`. Metadata edits do not touch presence — presence is owned by the register heartbeat.

**Events:** `devices.user_device.registered`, `devices.user_device.deactivated`.

### Module 2 — extensions to `notifications`

**2a. DB-backed type registry.** New `NotificationType` (`notification_types`) mirrors the in-memory `NotificationTypeDefinition` aggregate so remote clients can enumerate types. The in-memory registry stays the source of truth for code; the table is a read-through mirror reconciled by a subscriber on `notifications.type_registry.sync`, and lazily by `GET /api/notifications/types`. The message title/body lives on the per-instance `Notification` row — this entity is only the catalogue. `label_key`/`description_key` resolve via locale JSON, not the runtime `translations.ts` system, because types are code-registered rather than tenant-defined.

**2b. Channel-agnostic preferences.** New `NotificationPreference` (`notification_preferences`), unique on `(tenant, user, notification_type_id, channel)`, with a free-form `channel` string. Rows are **lazy-seeded**: absence means the type's per-channel **default** applies (see 2b′). `NotificationPreferenceService` (DI) exposes `isChannelEnabled` / `setPreferences` / `listForUser`; channel modules consume the service, never the table.

**2b′. Operator-editable channel eligibility (tenant-scoped).** The per-type eligibility field `NotificationTypeDefinition.channels` (gate step 2 — checked before both the `nonOptOut` bypass and user preferences, so a channel outside the set is completely off for the type) gains a **per-tenant** operator override: new `NotificationTypeOverride` (`notification_type_overrides`, unique on `(tenant, notification_type_id)`, nullable `channels` JSONB + nullable `non_opt_out` — lazy-seeded like preferences; the catalogue sync never touches it), edited via `PATCH /api/notifications/types` or the type-catalogue table on the Notification Delivery settings page. Overrides are strictly tenant-scoped: a tenant admin's edit never changes delivery for another tenant, and the gate reads only the caller tenant's rows. A stored array **replaces** the code-declared set; an absent row (or `NULL` field) inherits it; effective = `stored ?? code ?? all channels`. Every user-configurable built-in type declares its intended eligibility explicitly: business and actionable types use `['in_app', 'email']`, while the demo push fixtures use `['push']`. Push therefore ships off for business notifications so a freshly connected provider cannot flood devices with catalogue-wide pushes, and an operator re-enables it per type without a code change. The hidden `admin.custom_message` and `admin.custom_silent` types remain unrestricted because they bypass the catalogue, preferences, and normal notification row entirely and fan out only through the admin custom-push service. For a channel outside the effective set, `setPreferences` drops writes server-side and both preference UIs render the cell locked off; channels inside the set behave exactly as before (user preferences, absent row ⇒ enabled). `GET /api/notifications/types` exposes `channels` (effective for the caller's tenant), `storedChannels`/`storedNonOptOut` (raw override), and `updatedAt` (the override row's optimistic-lock version; the PATCH replaces the whole `channels` array, so writes send the standard `x-om-ext-optimistic-lock-expected-updated-at` header and a stale admin view 409s instead of silently reverting a concurrent edit — surfaced by the unified conflict bar). The `nonOptOut` flag follows the same contract via the same row: `true` forces a type on for the tenant's users, `false` makes a code-required type user-editable, `NULL` inherits the code declaration; the mirrored `notification_types.non_opt_out` column stays a pure code mirror. Clearing both fields deletes the override row.

**2c. Module-registered channel catalogue.** `NotificationChannelDefinition` + an in-memory channel registry fed by a `generators.ts` plugin that discovers each module's `notification-channels.ts` and emits `notification-channels.generated.ts`. `GET /api/notifications/channels` serves the registry directly — no DB mirror, because the set is tiny. A third-party module registers a channel with **zero core edits**. Core dogfoods this by shipping `in_app`, `email`, and `push` through the same mechanism.

**2d. The single delivery gate.** `lib/shouldDeliver.ts` (`shouldDeliver` + `resolveEffectiveChannels`) composes: per-send target ∩ per-type eligibility ∩ registered strategies ∩ the recipient's preference (with `nonOptOut` bypassing it). `silent` composes orthogonally — it selects delivery *style*, never enforcement. The gate runs **once at create time** and its result is snapshotted onto `Notification.channels`; the dispatcher replays that set before each `strategy.deliver(ctx)`. Legacy `channels = NULL` rows recompute via `resolveEffectiveChannels` and are treated as "all channels / visible".

**Events:** `notifications.preference.updated`.

### Module 3 — `push_notifications` (new, in `@open-mercato/core`)

Owns the delivery log, the fan-out, and the worker. It owns **no provider code**: the hub's `channelAdapterRegistry` is the provider seam.

- `PushNotificationDelivery` (`push_notification_deliveries`) — append-only; snapshots `provider` and a last-8 `token_snapshot` so the audit trail survives token rotation and device deletion. Statuses: `pending | sending | sent | failed | skipped | expired`. `expired` (retries exhausted) is deliberately distinct from `failed` so the admin log carries real signal.
- The `push` `NotificationDeliveryStrategy` is **enqueue-only** — it resolves devices, snapshots provider + token tail, inserts `pending` rows, and enqueues. This keeps notification creation off the provider's latency path.
- `workers/send-push.worker.ts` claims a row with an atomic `pending → sending` transition (exactly-once *send* under an at-least-once queue), retries with exponential backoff to `MAX_ATTEMPTS = 3`, and on the uniform `device_unregistered` sentinel soft-deletes the source device through the `devices.user_devices.deactivate` command (no business-logic import).
- `workers/reclaim-stuck.worker.ts` recovers rows a crashed worker stranded in `sending`, **and** orphaned `pending` rows whose enqueue was lost after the INSERT committed. `attempts` increments immediately after the claim and is persisted before the provider send, so `MAX_ATTEMPTS` caps real provider sends across crashes. `OM_PUSH_STUCK_RECLAIM_MINUTES` rejects any value below 1, falling back to the default of 5 — a `0` would re-open actively-sending rows and duplicate pushes. The same tick drives Expo receipt polling.

Cross-module reads resolve softly via DI tokens; links are declared in `data/extensions.ts`. There are no token-management APIs here — tokens are device fields.

**Events:** `push_notifications.delivery.sent`, `push_notifications.delivery.failed`.

### Provider adapters — `packages/channel-{fcm,apns,expo}`

Each is a hub `ChannelAdapter` package mirroring `channel-gmail`: `channelType: 'push'`, `capabilities.realtimePush: true`, `channelScope: 'tenant'`, a credentials zod schema, a health check, and the SDK isolated behind an exported test seam (`setFcmMessagingFactory` / `setApnsSenderFactory` / `setExpoClientFactory`). Push channels leave the channel row's `pollIntervalSeconds` unset — it is a row field sourced from route input, not part of `capabilities`.

The provider client is cached per credentials hash. **FCM and APNs** bound that cache with an LRU at 32, calling `app.delete()` / `shutdown()` on eviction: an unbounded cache would leak a live HTTP/2 socket (APNs) or an OAuth refresh timer (FCM) per key rotation. **Expo does not bound its cache** — its SDK is a stateless HTTP client holding no socket or timer, so an evictionless `Map` leaks nothing worth reclaiming. In all three, a **rejected** init promise self-evicts so a transient failure cannot poison the cache until process restart.

**Push channels are tenant-wide infrastructure.** One FCM service account serves every device in the tenant, so the channel row is stored with `organization_id = NULL` and its credentials are pinned to `organizationId = tenantId`. Read and write therefore land on the same key regardless of which org the connecting admin had selected. Connecting is admin-gated (`communication_channels.connect_tenant_channel`); the per-user connect route refuses a tenant-scoped provider with `403 provider_is_tenant_scoped`. (`wrong_scope_for_route` is a different thing: a command result status that the *tenant* route surfaces as a 500, unreachable in practice.)

Each adapter maps its provider's permanent-token errors to the **uniform `device_unregistered` sentinel** so the worker's device soft-delete fires identically:

| Provider | Permanent-token errors → `device_unregistered` |
|---|---|
| FCM | `messaging/registration-token-not-registered`, `messaging/invalid-registration-token` |
| APNs | `Unregistered` (410), `BadDeviceToken` (400) |
| Expo | `DeviceNotRegistered` (receipt phase), malformed `!Expo.isExpoPushToken` |

### Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| `devices` is its own module, **not** folded into `communication_channels` | They are orthogonal axes: the hub routes *messages* between providers and the unified inbox and has no notion of devices or push tokens; a user can have 5 devices and 0 channels, or 1 device and 3 email channels. Folding device storage into `push_notifications` would force MFA (#539), session-aware auth, and audit-log consumers to depend on the push module. Subsuming it into the hub would be the "wrong kind of reuse" — one abstraction serving two unrelated purposes. |
| Push *delivery* nevertheless rides the `communication_channels` hub | Maintainer mandate on #2595: *"push notifications support via the `communication_channels` hub … so it will be end2end feature."* Verified feasible with **no `ChannelAdapter` contract change**. This satisfies the end-to-end demand without collapsing the device registry into the hub. |
| **No `PushProvider` interface** in `push_notifications` | The hub's `channelAdapterRegistry` *is* the provider seam. A second seam would be a parallel, divergent registry. The strategy calls `adapter.sendMessage(...)` once per device token, exactly as `channels/[id]/test-send` does — not the conversation/message pipeline. |
| Type registry + preferences live in `notifications`, not `push_notifications` | Preferences are inherently cross-channel. A future `email_notifications` module would otherwise duplicate the table or depend on the push module — both wrong. There is one catalogue of "things a system can notify a user about"; in-app, push, and email are *renderings* of it. |
| `NotificationPreference` = one row per `(user, type, channel)` with a free-form `channel` string | Adding `email`/`sms` is new rows, not a schema change. A `(user, type)` row with per-channel boolean columns (`push_enabled`/`email_enabled`) would require a migration per channel. |
| Preferences are lazy-seeded (absent row ⇒ enabled) | Avoids backfilling a row for every user × every type whenever a new type is registered. Apps wanting default-off insert explicit `enabled=false` rows at type registration. |
| `UserDevice` carries push-token fields directly | Single token per `(device, app install)` is the universal case for FCM/APNs/Expo. A separate token entity is YAGNI; splitting later is one migration. |
| Device identity includes `organization_id` | Without it, re-registering the same device in a different org would silently *move* the existing row between orgs. |
| The gate runs once at create time and is snapshotted onto `Notification.channels` | Behaviorally equivalent to a per-deliver gate but computed once. It also promotes `channels` from a descriptive audit field to the authoritative target set, so channel targeting can never bypass opt-out enforcement. |
| `silent` selects delivery style; only `nonOptOut` bypasses preferences | A silent push is still a notification. Conflating the two would let any `silent` type ignore a user's opt-out. |
| FCM `messaging/invalid-argument` is **excluded** from the permanent-token set | FCM v1 returns it for *any* malformed request field, not just a bad token. Mapping it to `device_unregistered` would let a single payload-shape bug progressively soft-delete every targeted device tenant-wide. It falls through to the retryable path. |
| APNs returns an **empty** `externalMessageId` on success | node-apn has no message id. A truncated-token substitute (e.g. `token.slice(-12)`) would persist raw token characters into the admin-exposed `provider_response`, undercutting the last-8-only secrecy contract. |
| The delivery strategy is enqueue-only; a worker sends | Keeps notification creation off the provider's latency path. |
| Exactly-once send via an atomic `pending → sending` claim | The queue is at-least-once; a redelivered job would otherwise re-send. `attempts` increments immediately after the claim and is flushed before the provider call, so `MAX_ATTEMPTS` holds across worker crashes. |
| `expired` is a distinct terminal state from `failed` | Retries-exhausted and hard-failure are different operational signals in the admin log. |
| Push channel rows use `organization_id = NULL`, credentials pinned to `organizationId = tenantId` | Channel dedup/heal is org-agnostic. Keying credentials by the connecting admin's selected org would mean an org-B key rotation writes a credential row that the delivery path (reading at `channel.organizationId ?? tenantId`) never finds. |
| Tenant-scoped providers are **refused** (`403 provider_is_tenant_scoped`) on the per-user connect route, not silently downgraded | A silent downgrade (`effectiveUserId = null`) would let a non-admin holding only `connect_user_channel` mint or overwrite the shared tenant-wide push channel — a privilege-escalation bypass of the admin-only `connect_tenant_channel` ACL. |
| `push_notifications` ships **no `commands/`** — admin custom-send writes through a DI service | Every other reference module routes writes through the Command pattern, so this is a deliberate exception, not an oversight. Delivery rows are an append-only log and the actual send is worker-driven and asynchronous: by the time an operator could "undo", the provider has already accepted the push. An undoable command would imply a reversibility that does not exist. Devices, whose registry rows *are* reversible, does use commands. |
| `setup.ts` swallows the `type_registry.sync` seed error | Contrary to the module norm (customers/sales/catalog throw to abort init for required reference data). Justified only because the emit is a best-effort nudge with a reliable fallback: `GET /api/notifications/types` reconciles lazily. Same pattern as `communication_channels` and `customer_accounts`. |
| `findWithDecryption` is used even though `TenantEncryptionSubscriber.onLoad` auto-decrypts | The subscriber only resolves entities whose own `tenant_id`/`organization_id` it can read. Keeping the helper is both convention (~1000+ read sites; AGENTS.md guidance, not an enforced gate) and fail-safe if the subscriber is absent from that EM or the entity later gains encrypted fields. |
| Provider-adapter tests use env-gated **in-process fakes** that swap the SDK *client*, never the adapter | `registerChannelAdapter` throws on a duplicate provider key, so the real adapter object stays registered and merely has its client swapped. This means real message construction, credential parsing, client caching, and every error→sentinel mapping execute end-to-end. |
| The fake records native messages to a **JSONL sink**, not `provider_response` | See § Alternatives Considered — it is infeasible via the delivery row, and a file (not memory) is required because the adapter runs in a different *process* than the spec. |
| Golden-file assertions use exact `toEqual` fixtures, not Jest snapshots | A snapshot silently re-records drift under `--updateSnapshot` instead of failing — the exact opposite of what the goldens exist for. |
| The APNs golden builds against a real `apn.Notification` | Production builds via `buildApnsNotification(new Notification(), payload)`. Pinning a plain-object projection the SDK never serializes would leave a hole in exactly the drift-detection the goldens exist for. The goldens pin a non-obvious fact: the envelope's custom `data` rides as top-level keys beside `aps` on **every** branch, visible as well as silent. |
| Root `resolutions` pin `node-forge@1.4.0` | `@parse/node-apn` (declared `^6.0.1`, resolving to `6.5.0`) declares `node-forge` as an **exact** version (`1.3.1`), not a range, so no install can pick up a security patch. Documented in `packages/channel-apns/AGENTS.md` and `UPGRADE_NOTES.md`. |

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Why Rejected |
|-------------|--------------|
| Fold `devices` into the `communication_channels` hub | Orthogonal concerns; the hub has no device/token axis. Would force one abstraction to serve two unrelated purposes. (Push *delivery* does ride the hub — the device *registry* does not.) |
| A `PushProvider` interface + FCM/APNs implementations inside `push_notifications` (the original draft) | Superseded by the maintainer mandate on #2595. It would have created a second provider seam parallel to the hub's `channelAdapterRegistry`. |
| One combined push module (devices + preferences + delivery in one) | A combined module, boolean-column preferences, and a required-token device entity each fail an upstream platform constraint — see § Design Decisions. |
| A `sendSilentPush` primitive that writes no `Notification` row and bypasses preferences | Silent push rides the ordinary `notificationService.create()` flow instead: the row is still written, and preferences still apply unless the type is `nonOptOut`. Unifying on the create flow genuinely shrinks the surface, and the bypass would conflate delivery style with enforcement. |
| A separate `PushToken` entity | YAGNI. One token per `(device, app install)` is universal across FCM/APNs/Expo. |
| A **fake HTTP provider server** for integration tests | Three independent reasons. (0) It does not buy what it appears to: it cannot validate conformance with the real provider, because its schema is our own belief about the contract — a wrong belief passes under either approach. (1) Its sole genuine gain is running the vendor SDK's client-side validation, and that is structurally unavailable for FCM: `firebase-admin@13.10.0` hardcodes `const FCM_SEND_HOST = 'fcm.googleapis.com'` and ships no messaging emulator, so FCM needs the in-process shim regardless — a server buys *nothing* for the provider that runs in production. (2) Every existing external-service fake in this repo is in-process and env-gated, while the one fake *service* (LocalStack) appears in no workflow file, so discovery silently drops its four `TC-ATT-004..007` specs from every CI run. A compose sidecar would repeat that failure mode. |
| Surface the provider-native message through the delivery row's `provider_response` | Infeasible without editing `adapter.ts`. No adapter returns `metadata` on success — the worker persists only `{ externalMessageId }`. FCM and Expo could smuggle it through the id string; **APNs cannot**, because it deliberately hardcodes an empty id that is admin-exposed and must never carry token material. |
| An in-memory array to record fake sends | The adapter never runs in the spec's process, and *which* process it runs in is not fixed (app server inline / drain child / Playwright). A module-level array would live in whichever one happened to run it — the flakiest possible failure. The queue already crosses those boundaries via `QUEUE_BASE_DIR`; the sink rides the same directory. |
| A new HTTP/IPC endpoint to read fake sends | A production surface for a test-only concern. |
| Range-partitioning `push_notification_deliveries` | A 90-day purge worker is the cheaper first step. Both are tracked in § Deferred Follow-ups. |

## Architecture

### Commands & Events

- **Commands:** `devices.user_devices.register`, `devices.user_devices.update`, `devices.user_devices.deactivate` (one undoable command per file, matching `sales`/`customers`). The middle segment is the **entity**, not the module — mirroring `customers.people.create` and agreeing with this module's own `devices.user_device.*` event ids and `resourceKind`.
- **Events (feature-level):** `devices.user_device.{registered,deactivated}`, `notifications.preference.updated`, `push_notifications.delivery.{sent,failed}`.
- **Events (infrastructural):** `devices` additionally emits the standard `devices.user_device.{created,updated,deleted}` CRUD lifecycle events via `emitCrudSideEffects`, and `notifications` declares `notifications.type_registry.sync` (the type-mirror reconciliation nudge, § Module 2a).

> `delivery.failed` carries `status: 'retrying'` on a retryable failure — deliberately *not* the reset row status `pending`, so a subscriber keying off `status` is not misled. Subscribers counting ultimate failures must still filter on `willRetry !== true`.

### Admin UI placement

| Surface | Location | Why there |
|---|---|---|
| Devices (list/create/edit) | Settings → Auth | User-adjacent registry, next to User Notification Preferences |
| User Notification Preferences (admin) | Settings → Auth | Admin edits *other users'* preferences — an auth/user-admin task |
| Notification Delivery (type catalogue) | Settings → Module Configs | It is module configuration |
| Push Deliveries (log) + Send Push (tool) | Settings → External systems | Operational delivery log + send tool for external providers — same nature as Webhooks deliveries and Payment Transactions |
| Communication Channels (connect FCM/APNs/Expo) | Main sidebar → Integrations | Pre-existing hub page; push providers ride it |
| Notification Preferences (own) | Profile — entry in the top-right profile dropdown (`notifications.injection.profile-preferences-menu` widget, mirroring `communication_channels`' pattern) | `pageContext: 'profile'` pages are otherwise only reachable from the profile-mode sidebar |
| My communication channels (own) | Profile dropdown (pre-existing widget) | Per-user channel connect |

## Data Models

### UserDevice (`user_devices`)
- `id` (uuid PK), `tenant_id`, `organization_id` (nullable), `user_id`
- `device_id` (client-supplied stable id, e.g. iOS `identifierForVendor`), `platform` (`ios|android|web`)
- `client_app_version`, `os_version`, `locale` (text|null)
- `push_token` (text|null, **encrypted at rest**), `push_provider` (text|null), `push_token_updated_at`
- `last_seen_at`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at`
- Unique (non-deleted): `(tenant_id, organization_id, user_id, device_id)` with `NULLS NOT DISTINCT`
- Optimistic-locked on metadata edits; deactivate is exempt (idempotent soft-delete of a registry row has no lost-update risk).

### NotificationType (`notification_types`)
- `id` (string PK, e.g. `orders.shipped`), `tenant_id` (nullable for system-wide)
- `label_key`, `description_key` (i18n keys), `category` (free-form string|null)
- `silent`, `non_opt_out` (bool)
- There is **no `hidden_from_settings` column**. `hiddenFromSettings` stays on the in-memory `NotificationTypeDefinition`: hidden types are excluded from the mirror entirely rather than stored behind a flag, and stale hidden rows are pruned on sync.
- Type IDs are **FROZEN** per `BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md`.

### NotificationPreference (`notification_preferences`)
- `id` (uuid PK), `tenant_id`, `user_id`, `notification_type_id`, `channel` (free-form), `enabled`
- Unique: `(tenant_id, user_id, notification_type_id, channel)`; absent row ⇒ enabled.

### Notification (`notifications`) — additive columns
- `channels` (JSONB|null — the resolved delivery-channel set; `NULL` ⇒ all channels / visible)
- `data` (JSONB|null — arbitrary app-readable string map), `push_options` (JSONB|null — push-only)

### PushNotificationDelivery (`push_notification_deliveries`)
- `id` (uuid PK), `tenant_id`, `organization_id`, `notification_id` (soft FK|null), `notification_type_id`
- `user_device_id` (soft FK via `data/extensions.ts`), `user_id`
- `provider` (snapshot), `token_snapshot` (**last 8 chars only**), `silent` (bool)
- `status` (`pending|sending|sent|failed|skipped|expired`), `attempts`, `last_error`, `next_retry_at`
- `payload` (JSONB), `provider_response` (JSONB|null), `created_at`, `sent_at`, `updated_at`
- Append-only; optimistic-lock exempt. Cross-module references are plain UUID columns declared as `EntityExtension` links in `data/extensions.ts`, never a direct ORM relationship.

## API Contracts

Schemas live in each module's `data/validators.ts` (zod); every route exports `openApi`.

| Method & path | ACL | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` / `GET /api/devices` | `devices.manage` / `devices.view` | Idempotent upsert; caller's own devices, active org |
| `PUT` / `DELETE /api/devices/:id` | `devices.manage` | Owner-only; 404 outside active org |
| `GET|POST /api/devices/admin/devices` | `devices.admin` | Org-scoped; `?userId=`, `?platform=` |
| `GET|PUT|DELETE /api/devices/admin/devices/:id` | `devices.admin` | 403 outside org scope |
| `GET /api/notifications/types` | `notifications.view` | Tenant-filtered; excludes `hiddenFromSettings` types |
| `GET /api/notifications/channels` | `notifications.view` | Registry-driven |
| `GET|PUT /api/notifications/preferences` | `notifications.manage_preferences` | PUT sends only the diff; `setPreferences` refuses opt-out rows for `nonOptOut` types |
| `GET|PUT /api/notifications/admin/preferences?userId=` | `notifications.manage_user_preferences` | Target gated by `assertActorCanAccessUserTarget` (tenant **and** org) |
| `GET /api/push_notifications/deliveries[/:id]` | `push_notifications.view_deliveries` | Read-only; never exposes the full token |
| `POST /api/push_notifications/custom-send` | `push_notifications.send_custom` | Returns `200` + `enqueued: 0` + `no_matching_devices_in_scope` on the no-op branch |
| `POST /api/communication_channels/channels/connect/tenant-credentials` | `communication_channels.connect_tenant_channel` | The only path that connects a push provider |

```ts
// PUT /api/devices/:id — null clears the token (user revoked OS permission)
const UpdateDeviceSchema = z.object({
  clientAppVersion: z.string().optional(),
  osVersion: z.string().optional(),
  pushToken: z.string().min(1).nullable().optional(),
  pushProvider: z.string().min(1).nullable().optional(),
})

// PUT /api/notifications/preferences
const UpdatePreferencesSchema = z.object({
  preferences: z.array(z.object({
    notificationTypeId: z.string(),
    channel: z.string(),
    enabled: z.boolean(),
  })),
})
```

## Migration & Backward Compatibility

**Purely additive across every contract surface** in `BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md`. Nothing is removed, renamed, or narrowed, so no deprecation bridge is required — with one deprecation and one intentional corrective behavior change, both below.

- `packages/shared/.../notifications/types.ts` — 6 new **optional** fields on `NotificationTypeDefinition` (`labelKey`, `descriptionKey`, `category`, `silent`, `nonOptOut`, `hiddenFromSettings`), plus optional `channels` eligibility and `NotificationDto.data`. Required fields untouched.
- `notifications/data/entities.ts` — 3 new **nullable** JSON columns on `Notification` (`channels`, `data`, `push_options`); 2 brand-new tables.
- `auth/notifications.ts` — `nonOptOut: true` set on 2 existing security types. Type IDs unchanged; per-channel preferences arrive in this same branch, so there is no prior opt-out behavior to regress.

**Deprecation.** `NotificationDeliveryContext` splits into a channel-agnostic `NotificationDeliveryContextCore` and `EmailDeliveryExtras` (`panelUrl`, `panelLink`, `actionLinks` — all three `@deprecated`). The flat intersection is retained so existing strategies compile and run unchanged; the email-shaped fields move behind an email-scoped accessor in a future major (§ Deferred Follow-ups). `recipient.email` stays on the **core** context and is *not* deprecated — a recipient's address is channel-neutral identity, not an email-template detail.

**Intentional corrective behavior change.** Per-channel opt-out and the `nonOptOut`/`silent` flags are now enforced on **every** channel, not just push. Previously, disabling `in_app` or `email` for a type was silently ignored. A user who never changed their preferences sees no difference (preferences default to on). `Notification.channels` becomes authoritative rather than merely descriptive; legacy `NULL` rows and untargeted sends behave exactly as before. A tenant-wide (`organization_id = NULL`) channel is visible and deletable from any org in the tenant — without this, the shared push channel would be unmanageable once created.

**Database safety (fork-safe, no backfill).** Against pre-existing schema, every migration is `CREATE TABLE`, `ADD COLUMN ... NULL`, or `ADD COLUMN ... NOT NULL DEFAULT <const>` — no rename, drop, type-narrowing, or index removal. The only pre-existing core table touched is `notifications` (nullable JSON adds). Within the branch, `user_devices` reaches its final org-aware unique index by replacing one an earlier migration in the same branch created; that table does not exist upstream, so nothing deployed is altered.

**Post-merge:** run `yarn mercato auth sync-role-acls` for the new ACL features. Forks adopting these modules replicate the `modules.ts` entries and run `yarn generate` — expected app boilerplate, not a contract change.

## Implementation Plan

Each phase is a self-contained, demoable vertical slice that ships its own admin UI. The phase list is the unit of work and review; the branch ships as one PR, one commit per phase.

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `devices` module — entities, migrations, APIs, ACL, setup | Done |
| 2 | `notifications` extensions — type catalogue, preferences, both preference UIs | Done |
| 3 | `push_notifications` rails — delivery log, `push` strategy, worker, `push_stub`, delivery-log UI | Done |
| 4 | Provider adapters (`channel-{fcm,apns,expo}`) + `push_token` encryption at rest | Done |
| 5 | Silent push + flexible push payload (`data`, `pushOptions`) | Done |
| 6 | Per-device locale, admin custom send, hygiene | Done |
| 7 | Unify **all** channels on the delivery-strategy seam | Done |
| 8 | Provider-adapter e2e coverage without live credentials | Done |

**Phase 4** splits internally into a core contract layer (`BasePushChannelAdapter`, `push-capabilities`, `readPushEnvelope`, token encryption, per-device provider routing) and three independent provider packages that depend only on that contract.

**Phase 7** decomposes into ordered sub-phases: (7.0) the additive `Notification.channels` column and per-type eligibility; (7.1) the single `shouldDeliver` gate; (7.2) the module-registered channel catalogue and registry-driven preferences UI; (7.3) in-app and email as first-class strategies, with `isConfigured`/`supports` capability hooks and the context split; (7.4) the gate wired at create time (push has no inline gate of its own); (7.5) in-app visibility applied to the inbox, unread count, `markAllAsRead`, and the bell SSE; (7.6) coverage.

> Broadcast paths resolve channels for the whole recipient set *before* the write transaction, reusing one forked EM (R forks → 1). The remaining R×C preference reads are inherent to the default-on per-user/per-channel model; batching them is tracked in § Deferred Follow-ups.

**Phase 8** makes each adapter's already-exported client seam installable from `OM_PUSH_FAKE_PROVIDERS` via each package's `di.ts`, copying the `ensurePushStubAdapterRegistered()` production-safety pattern (no-op unless the flag is set, never installed at import, inert in production). Installing in `di.ts` `register()` is safe because `createRequestContainer()` runs every registrar and the queue builds a fresh container per job — a hard barrier before the first `sendMessage`. The registry is a `globalThis` singleton *per process* and the worker runs in its own process, so the flag must reach both harness env blocks. `push_stub`, `TC-PUSH-003`, and `TC-CHANNEL-PUSH-001..004` are untouched.

### Testing Strategy

Integration specs are colocated in `__integration__/`, self-contained (fixtures created in setup, cleaned in teardown), and gated by a sibling `.meta.ts` where they need an env flag.

| Spec | Covers |
|---|---|
| `TC-DEV-001`, `005`, `006` | Self-serve + admin trees, `last_seen_at` presence semantics, optimistic lock, org dimension, `push_token` encryption at rest, admin cross-org denial |
| `TC-NOTIF-011..014` | Type catalogue, preferences round-trip, `data`/`pushOptions` payload, in-app/email opt-out + per-send channel targeting |
| `TC-PUSH-001..003` | Delivery-log ACL/scoping/token secrecy; admin custom send; real pipeline → `sent` (org propagation) via `push_stub` |
| `TC-PUSH-004..009` | Real adapters: `unregistered` → `failed` + device soft-deleted; `fail` → `MAX_ATTEMPTS` → `expired`, device survives; silent → data-only; `pushOptions` round-trip; Expo async receipt → device pruned; admin send page → delivery log |
| `TC-CHANNEL-PUSH-001..004` | Each adapter registered and reachable through the real credential-connect route (fcm carries two: per-user refusal + tenant-wide connect) |
| `TC-CHANNEL-PUSH-005..007` | Each **real** adapter drives a delivery to `sent` and records a correct provider-native message (`aps.badge`, `apns-push-type: background`, `android.notification.channelId`, Expo `sound`/`priority`) |

Unit suites cover each adapter's success / transient / permanent-token mappings, the gate, both new strategies, the channel registry, and — via `message-golden.test.ts` — serialization drift in our own message builders.

Three harness notes. `TC-PUSH-005` cannot reach its terminal state in one drain, because each retry re-enqueues behind exponential backoff + jitter; it drains repeatedly inside an `expect.poll`. `TC-PUSH-008` needs the receipt reaper, which no scheduler runs under Playwright (the spec enqueues a tick itself) and which skips rows younger than `OM_PUSH_RECEIPT_MIN_AGE_MINUTES` (the harness pins it to `0`). And any spec whose own waits approach a minute must call `test.setTimeout(...)` explicitly: `test.slow()` merely triples the config's `timeout: 20_000`, so a 60s poll inside a `slow()` test consumes the entire budget and the test dies before the poll can reach its deadline. `TC-PUSH-005`/`009` and `TC-CHANNEL-PUSH-005..007` — whose queue drains plus a 30s poll fit under 60s on an idle laptop but not on a loaded CI runner — therefore budget explicitly (`test.setTimeout(120_000)`).

**Locating `CrudForm` fields from a UI spec.** `CrudForm` renders a field's `<label>` as a sibling of the control, with no `htmlFor` and without wrapping it, so `page.getByLabel(...)` never resolves a CrudForm field. `ComboboxInput` likewise renders its suggestions as `<Button>`s in a popover rather than ARIA `option`s. Locate the field through its label's wrapper and click suggestions by their visible label.

**`OM_PUSH_FAKE_PROVIDERS` must be set on the process that SENDS, not the one that asserts.** The fake swaps the provider SDK *client* inside `di.ts` `register()`, so it only exists in a process that built a container. Whichever process claims the delivery job does the send; the ephemeral harness sets the flag in both the app env and the drain child (`packages/cli/src/lib/testing/integration.ts`), so either may claim it safely.

The sibling `.meta.ts` (`requiredEnvVars: ['OM_PUSH_FAKE_PROVIDERS']`) already skips these specs when the flag is absent from the **test** process, which is the ordinary protection. The residual footgun is exporting the flag by hand and pointing the specs at a **live server that lacks it**: the gate then passes, that server's in-process worker claims the job before the drain child, and it calls the *real* provider. The synthetic token is rejected (`registration token is not a valid FCM registration token`), retried to `expired`, and the poll for `sent` fails — and on a server holding real credentials it delivers a **real push to the recipient's real devices**. Either start the server with `OM_PUSH_FAKE_PROVIDERS=1`, or let the gate skip them.

**Fake-sink safety.** The JSONL sink is append-only and is **not** truncated on the reused-environment path. A compile-time-constant token tail would let a *previous* run's entry satisfy an assertion before this run's worker wrote anything — a false pass, which is worse than a failure because it hollows out the evidence the phase exists to produce. Two guards, both required: every spec draws a run-unique tail from `uniquePushTokenTail()` (`crypto.randomBytes`), and `findFakePush(provider, tail, sinceIso)` rejects entries older than the caller. Reads skip malformed lines, since a reader can observe a line the writer has not finished appending.

## Risks & Impact Review

#### Push token leaks through a generic platform surface
- **Scenario**: A surface that echoes write payloads or snapshots back to clients — audit-log `snapshotBefore`/`snapshotAfter` and the derived `changesJson` via `audit_logs.view_self`, or enterprise record-lock conflict details — carries the raw token. Admin register-on-behalf is the sharpest case: the snapshot would hold another user's token.
- **Severity**: High · **Affected area**: `devices`, `audit_logs`, enterprise mutation guard
- **Mitigation**: Encrypted at rest; redacted from persisted command snapshots; stripped from the mutation-guard payload; never in any list/detail field set; retained only in the non-exposed undo payload. Asserted by `devices/__tests__/push-token-redaction.test.ts`.
- **Residual risk**: Low.

#### A payload bug soft-deletes every device in the tenant
- **Scenario**: A provider error that is *not* actually a permanent token error is mapped to `device_unregistered`; the worker then soft-deletes each targeted device. FCM's `messaging/invalid-argument` is returned for any malformed request field.
- **Severity**: High · **Affected area**: `push_notifications` worker, `devices`
- **Mitigation**: Only `registration-token-not-registered` and `invalid-registration-token` are permanent for FCM. `invalid-argument` falls through to the retryable path. Every mapping is unit-tested per adapter and exercised end-to-end in `TC-PUSH-004`.
- **Residual risk**: Low.

#### Duplicate push from an at-least-once queue
- **Scenario**: The dispatch subscriber is at-least-once, so redelivery re-runs the strategy; and a reaper that reclaims an in-flight `sending` row causes a double send.
- **Severity**: Medium · **Affected area**: `push_notifications` worker
- **Mitigation**: Atomic `pending → sending` claim; fan-out inserts use `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`; `attempts` increments right after the claim and is flushed before the send, so `MAX_ATTEMPTS` holds across crashes; `OM_PUSH_STUCK_RECLAIM_MINUTES` rejects sub-1 values and falls back to 5 (a `0` would re-open actively-sending rows).
- **Residual risk**: Low. The invariant `send timeout < reclaim minutes` is documented, not enforced.

#### Cross-org credential orphaning
- **Scenario**: Tenant-wide push credentials keyed by the connecting admin's selected org, while channel dedup is org-agnostic — an org-B key rotation writes a credential row the delivery path never reads, and push silently stops.
- **Severity**: High · **Affected area**: `communication_channels`, `push_notifications`
- **Mitigation**: Tenant-scoped credentials are pinned to `organizationId = tenantId` and the channel row stores `organization_id = NULL`, so read and write land on the same key. Covered by `2026-07-03-push-channels-tenant-scope.md`.
- **Residual risk**: Low.

#### Privilege escalation onto the shared push channel
- **Scenario**: A non-admin holding only `connect_user_channel` posts FCM credentials to the per-user connect route and mints or overwrites the tenant-wide push channel.
- **Severity**: High · **Affected area**: `communication_channels`
- **Mitigation**: The per-user route short-circuits tenant-scoped providers with `403 provider_is_tenant_scoped` before touching credentials, instead of silently downgrading; the connect command independently reports `wrong_scope_for_route` if a per-user scope ever reaches the tenant route.
- **Residual risk**: Low.

#### Cross-org push silently drops
- **Scenario**: Notifications are stamped with the *creator's* org, and the push strategy scopes the recipient's device lookup to that org. An admin in org A notifying a user whose devices live in org B delivers in-app but no push.
- **Severity**: Medium · **Affected area**: `push_notifications`
- **Mitigation**: Same-org and self are the paths in use; skipped devices are warn-logged with a count so a provider-config gap is diagnosable. The fix — scoping the device lookup by the *recipient's* org — is tracked in § Deferred Follow-ups.
- **Residual risk**: Medium — accepted, documented, not yet exercised.

#### Lazy preference seeding surprises existing users
- **Scenario**: A new notification type is registered; every existing user is opted in by default.
- **Severity**: Medium · **Affected area**: UX
- **Mitigation**: Default-on is a documented contract. Apps wanting default-off insert explicit `enabled=false` rows at type registration.
- **Residual risk**: Low.

#### `push_notification_deliveries` grows unbounded
- **Scenario**: Every push writes an append-only row; no purge exists.
- **Severity**: Medium · **Affected area**: Storage
- **Mitigation**: None in this branch. The 90-day purge worker is tracked in § Deferred Follow-ups.
- **Residual risk**: Medium until the purge ships.

#### Notification type IDs are FROZEN — a typo sticks forever
- **Scenario**: A misspelled type ID is registered and mirrored to `notification_types`; mobile clients bind to it.
- **Severity**: High · **Affected area**: BC contract
- **Mitigation**: The frozen-id contract is documented in the module `AGENTS.md`. No new IDs are minted here — the DB mirrors the existing in-memory aggregate. Rename tooling is tracked in § Deferred Follow-ups.
- **Residual risk**: Low.

#### Provider-client cache leaks sockets or poisons itself
- **Scenario**: An unbounded cache keyed by credentials hash leaks an HTTP/2 socket (APNs) or an OAuth refresh timer (FCM) per key rotation; and a rejected init promise stays cached forever, so every later `getApp()` returns the cached rejection until the process restarts.
- **Severity**: Medium · **Affected area**: `channel-fcm`, `channel-apns`
- **Mitigation**: Both caches are LRU-bounded at 32 with `app.delete()` / `shutdown()` on eviction; rejected promises self-evict in all three adapters. Expo is unaffected — its stateless HTTP client holds no socket or timer — so its cache is intentionally unbounded.
- **Residual risk**: Low.

#### Conformance drift with the real providers
- **Scenario**: Our belief about a provider's payload shape is wrong. Every fake accepts it identically and CI stays green.
- **Severity**: Medium · **Affected area**: `channel-{fcm,apns,expo}`
- **Mitigation**: None available in CI, under *any* option — a fake server has the same blind spot, since its schema is also our own belief. Drift in **our** builders is caught by golden-file assertions against each provider's published reference. Drift in **theirs** stays a manual live-key check.
- **Residual risk**: Medium — stated deliberately. The only closure is a periodic live-credential smoke test, tracked in § Deferred Follow-ups.

## Deferred Follow-ups

**This is the single authoritative list.** Everything intentionally left out of scope is recorded here; no other section defers work on its own. Items were raised during design or review, are not blockers, and none of them is implied as done anywhere else in this spec.

### Product surface

| Item | Why deferred |
|---|---|
| Web push (browser Push API) | Plausible follow-up; needs its own credential and subscription model. |
| Email/SMS channel modules | The registry, preferences, and strategy seam are shaped to accept them additively. |
| Governance: `priority`, `group_key`, daily/weekly frequency caps (`FrequencyGuardService`) | A clean upstream design for how these compose with per-channel preference rows is still open. `category`, `non_opt_out`, `silent`, and `hidden_from_settings` are implemented. |
| Default push-channel policy for types that omit `channels` | A type without `channels` resolves to every registered channel (`resolveEligibleChannels` ⇒ `null`), so it delivers push once a tenant enables a push channel. Every type shipped here sets `channels` explicitly (`auth.*` = `['in_app', 'email']`), so nothing spams push today — but whether the platform-wide default should stay **opt-out-per-type** (operators disable it in the settings matrix) or become **push-opt-in** (a type must list `push` explicitly) is a maintainer policy call raised in PR review. Either is straightforward to implement in `shouldDeliver`. |
| Actionable push buttons | Feasible, not blocked. iOS registers `UNNotificationCategory` client-side (backend only picks the category); Android has no OS-level category→buttons and must build them from a data message via Notifee. The clean design projects the existing `NotificationTypeDefinition.actions` onto push rather than inventing a parallel `pushOptions.category` — one action model for in-app + iOS + Android. Parked on client-side work and an i18n decision, and it cannot be verified end-to-end in the current harness (Android emulator + FCM only). |
| `delivered` delivery state (device-confirmed receipt) | `sent` means the provider *accepted* the message. Only a client ack (delivery id echoed in the push `data`, posted back to a device-scoped, replay-guarded route) truly confirms receipt — APNs and FCM expose no device-delivery receipt, and Expo's receipts confirm handoff only. Deferred because the authoritative path is client-driven and not e2e-verifiable here. |
| Cross-org push (notify a user whose devices live outside the creator's org) | The push strategy scopes the device lookup to the *notification's* org, so an admin in org A notifying a user with org-B devices delivers in-app but no push. Same-org and self are the paths in use; skipped devices are warn-logged with a count. Scoping the lookup by the *recipient's* org is the fix if this is ever required. See § Risks. |
| Cross-user token handoff (deactivate a token that reappears under another user) | Rare; needs a decision on which user wins. |

### Platform & storage

| Item | Why deferred |
|---|---|
| Delivery-log purge worker (90-day default) + range partitioning of `push_notification_deliveries` | Storage hygiene; no app has hit the volume yet. The purge worker is the cheaper first step; partitioning follows only if volume warrants it. |
| GDPR data-export collectors + consumer-deletion purge for push data | Cross-cutting; belongs with a platform-wide GDPR pass. |
| Notification-type rename tooling | Type IDs are FROZEN per `BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md`, so a typo sticks forever. No IDs are minted here (the DB mirrors the existing in-memory aggregate), so tooling is not needed yet. |
| Retiring the `@deprecated` `NotificationDeliveryContext` flat intersection | The context split ships behind a compatibility bridge so existing strategies compile unchanged. The email-shaped fields (`panelUrl`, `panelLink`, `actionLinks`, `recipient.email`) move behind an email-scoped accessor in a future major, per the deprecation protocol. |
| Batched preference reads on broadcast fan-out | Broadcast resolves channels for the whole recipient set before the write transaction, reusing one forked EM (R forks → 1). The remaining R×C preference reads are inherent to the default-on per-user/per-channel model. A set-keyed batch query is worth it only if broadcast size warrants it. |
| Wiring or removing `channel_{fcm,apns,expo}.{view,configure}` ACL features | Granted in each package's `setup.ts` but never consulted by a `requireFeatures` guard — the connect flow uses `communication_channels.connect_tenant_channel`. Introduced with this feature, so not yet a BC concern. |
| RFC-4122-correct `stableScheduleUuid` | The helper is a verbatim copy of the `communication_channels` original and produces a uuid-*shaped* string Postgres accepts. Kept identical on purpose; three byte-identical copies now exist (`communication_channels`, `push_notifications`, `ai_assistant`), so fixing it means extracting a shared helper across all three. |
| `parseBooleanToken` cleanup for `isPushStubEnabled()` / `ensureTestSeedAdapterRegistered()` | Both pre-date the push stack and retain a hand-rolled env check. `OM_PUSH_FAKE_PROVIDERS` uses the helper. Unrelated to push behavior — separate cleanup. |

### Testing

| Item | Why deferred |
|---|---|
| Periodic live-credential conformance smoke test | The only way to catch drift in a *provider's* payload contract. No CI option closes it: a fake server's schema is also our own belief. Drift in **our** builders is already caught by the golden-file assertions. See § Risks. |
| Un-skipping `TC-CHANNEL-EMAIL-027/028` via the Phase-8 technique on `setImapClient`/`setSmtpClient` | Kept out of scope to avoid expanding into `channel-imap`. |
| A fake push provider *server* | Rejected on testing grounds (§ Alternatives Considered). The stronger case would be **product**: giving a downstream mobile app a live endpoint to develop against. Revisit on that basis. |

## Changelog

### 2026-08-26
- Review follow-up for issue #5495: added explicit `['in_app', 'email']` eligibility to the twelve visible enterprise notification types in `record_locks` and `security`. Replaced the regression test's hard-coded catalogue list with workspace discovery of every module-root `notifications.ts` under `packages/` and `apps/`; any future visible type that omits `channels` now fails automatically, while the two hidden admin custom-push types remain documented exceptions.
- **Reverses the "custom values stay allowed" decision below, on maintainer direction.** The register form's owner picker now sets `allowCustomValues: false`, so the owner must resolve to a real directory entry — `ComboboxInput.confirmSelection` reverts anything that is not a known option, and the form's `required` guard then blocks submit. What makes that safe is the other half of the change: `devices.admin` declares `dependsOn: ['auth.users.list']` in `devices/acl.ts`, and `devices/setup.ts` grants `auth.users.list` alongside `devices.*` to `superadmin`/`admin` rather than relying on the auth module's own `admin: ['auth.*']`. A role that can reach the register form can therefore also search the directory that fills it. The hint copy drops "or paste a user ID" in all five locales.
- **Precisely what "closed" means here**, verified in the browser rather than assumed: free text and a well-formed UUID belonging to nobody are both reverted and cannot be submitted. A raw id that *is* among the picker's known options still resolves to that person and is accepted — `ComboboxInput.findOptionForInput` matches on `option.value` as well as label, and `CrudForm` keeps the unfiltered first page (20 rows) as `suggestions` for the form's lifetime, so ids on that page stay matchable regardless of the current query. That is a real user the caller can already list, so it is not a hole; it does mean "pasting an id never works" would be the wrong thing to tell a user.
- **`dependsOn` is declarative, not enforcing** — it drives the ACL editor's missing-dependency diagnostics and its one-click fix, and `defaultRoleFeatures` reaches existing tenants only through `yarn mercato auth sync-role-acls`. A hand-built role holding `devices.admin` without `auth.users.list` therefore still exists until one of those two runs, and on that role the register form now offers no owner and cannot be submitted (the list and detail pages still render, degrading the owner column to raw ids). Run the sync after deploying. Coverage: `devices/__tests__/acl-dependencies.test.ts`.
- Review follow-ups on the same change: the unrendered `DeviceUserOption.description` is dropped (neither `CrudForm`'s combobox nor `FilterBar` reads it), the client batch cap imports `MAX_USER_LOOKUP_IDS` from `auth/lib/userIdFilter` instead of restating it behind a comment that named the wrong constant, the unreachable `else if (id)` arm in `auth/api/users/route.ts` is removed, the chunking fixture uses real UUIDs, and `useDeviceUserLabels` gains its own coverage (`devices/__tests__/use-device-user-labels.test.tsx`) for the failed-vs-answered retry bookkeeping.

### 2026-08-25
- The devices admin surface identifies an owner by person, not by UUID (upstream #5591). The *Register device* form's `userId` field is now the same searchable `combobox` the "Send push" form already uses (`/api/auth/users?search=`, `x-om-forbidden-redirect: '0'`, degrading to no options for a `devices.admin` who lacks `auth.users.list`). Custom values stay allowed on purpose: with the loader empty, a locked combobox would leave such an admin unable to register any device, and the server already rejects an unknown target with `devices.errors.user_not_found`. *(Superseded by the 2026-08-26 entry above.)*
- The list's owner column and the detail page's owner link now resolve the ids actually on screen instead of reusing whichever ~20 users the picker happened to prefetch, so a device whose owner never appeared in a search result stops rendering a bare UUID. Both call sites, plus the picker, share `devices/backend/devices/userOptions.ts` and `useDeviceUserLabels.ts`.
- `GET /api/auth/users` gained `?ids=<uuid>,<uuid>` (max 100, intersects with `?id=` and `?roleId=`, auto-sizes the page so a full batch is not truncated), reusing `parseIdsParam`/`isIdsParamProvided` from `shared/lib/crud/ids.ts` behind the unchanged `auth.users.list` feature. An `ids` value that contains no valid identifier matches nothing rather than falling back to the first page — the record-count side channel `mergeIdFilter` guards against for CRUD list routes. This also fixes `customers/components/detail/ActivitiesSection.tsx`, which already sent `?ids=` and silently received an unfiltered page. Coverage: `auth/__tests__/user-id-filter.test.ts`, `devices/__tests__/user-options.test.ts`, `TC-DEV-009`.

### 2026-08-23
- Fixed issue #5495 by making thirty-five distinct user-configurable notification types explicit on the current base across thirty-eight catalogue declarations: thirty-three business/actionable types now declare `['in_app', 'email']`, and the two demo push fixtures declare `['push']`. This includes the issue's twenty reported types, three document notifications that entered the default catalogue afterward, and twelve enterprise notifications added during review follow-up. The three app-local example declarations are mirrored into the create-app template. The hidden admin custom-push types and the legacy public fallback for third-party definitions that omit `channels` remain unchanged; a discovery-based workspace regression test now protects the user-configurable built-in policy.

### 2026-08-07
- Self-serve device listing no longer relies on a filter key the client can name. `GET /api/devices` now consumes the advanced filter itself (`consumeAdvancedFilterState` + `mergeAdvancedFilterTree`, the pattern customers/people, companies and deals already use) so the actor scope sits in its own `$and` element instead of a top-level key the CRUD factory's spread merge can overwrite. The earlier fix moved the scope from `user_id` to `$and`, which only changed which spelling a crafted `filter[conditions][0][field]=…` had to use.
- Both advanced-filter deserializers (flat v1 and tree v2) now drop a condition whose field names a Where combinator (`$and`/`$or`/`$not`), the same way an unrecognized operator is dropped. Field names are otherwise never validated against a route's allowlist, so such a condition previously compiled to a combinator key sharing the filter namespace with column names — reaching the engine as a filter on a non-existent column (matching every indexed row) or colliding with a key the route itself emitted. Route-level and parser-level fixes are independent: the route stops the collision, the parser stops the nonsense filter. Coverage: `TC-DEV-001` (`field=$and` returns the actor's own devices, not a 500 and not another user's) plus unit cases in `shared/lib/query/__tests__/advanced-filter.test.ts`.

### 2026-07-21
- Review fixes (PR #23): bounded the push-reaper per-tick scan (`OM_PUSH_STUCK_RECLAIM_BATCH_LIMIT`), guarded the fan-out enqueue-failure UPDATE on `status='pending'`, fixed tenant-wide (null-org) `pushUnregister` to look up + decrypt the channel at its own org, bounded the Expo client cache with an LRU, and swapped the devices active-unique index from a nil-UUID coalesce to `NULLS NOT DISTINCT`.
- Notification channel "black-hole" guards: the type-override PATCH schema now rejects an empty `channels` array (mirrors create; `null` still clears the override), the settings UI maps unchecking a type's last channel to `null` instead of `[]`, and the dispatcher's null-snapshot recompute only runs when strategies are registered (else keeps `channels` null) and falls back to null on a transient overrides/preference failure instead of aborting delivery.
- Recorded the default push-channel policy question (types that omit `channels` deliver on every channel including push) in § Deferred Follow-ups as a maintainer decision.

### 2026-07-20
- Localized type catalogue for the mobile settings screen: `GET /api/notifications/types` now returns server-resolved `label`, `description` and `categoryLabel` alongside the existing `labelKey`/`descriptionKey`/`category`, so a client without the app dictionary renders the screen directly. Locale comes from the repo-wide `resolveLocaleFromRequest` chain (`?locale=` → `x-locale` → cookie → `Accept-Language`), re-validated through `resolveSupportedLocale` because only that helper's `Accept-Language` branch validates its input — an unsupported value degrades to ambient detection instead of loading an empty dictionary.
- `category` is now always populated: `syncNotificationTypes` resolves it as `def.category ?? deriveCategory(def.type)` (prefix before the first dot), so the ~28 visible types stop mirroring as `null` and grouping works without hand-assigning a category per module. Existing rows are backfilled by the existing drift branch — no migration.
- Category labels live in the **declaring** module's `i18n/*.json` under the shared `notifications.categories.<key>` namespace; the `notifications` module ships none and holds no list of categories, so it stays ignorant of what groups exist. Missing translation ⇒ `categoryLabel === category` (raw key), which is also the client's signal that no server-side label exists.
- Contract note: `category` changes from "always `null`" to "always populated" for visible types. Verified no UI consumer reads it (`notifications/backend`, `notifications/widgets`: zero hits), so this is a value change on an existing response field with no rendering regression — additive everywhere else.

### 2026-07-16 (later)
- Operator-editable channel eligibility, tenant-scoped (§ 2b′): new `notification_type_overrides` table (unique per `(tenant, type)`; PATCH `/api/notifications/types` + settings-page catalogue) overrides the code-declared `NotificationTypeDefinition.channels` for the caller's tenant only; a channel outside the effective set is completely off for the type in that tenant (beats user preferences and `nonOptOut`; preference UIs lock the cell, `setPreferences` drops writes server-side). All 28 built-in types now declare `channels: ['in_app', 'email']` — push is re-enabled per type from the adminka. `nonOptOut` is overridable via the same row (`notification_types.non_opt_out` stays a pure code mirror). The PATCH enforces the standard optimistic-lock header against the override row's `updated_at` (`GET` returns it as `updatedAt`); conflicts surface via the unified conflict bar. `admin.custom_message`/`admin.custom_silent` stay unrestricted.

### 2026-07-16
- Implementation complete and verified on top of current upstream `develop`: full CI green (unit, lint, audit, docker, every integration shard — `TC-CHANNEL-PUSH-005..007` executed, not env-gate skipped; an earlier shard-local hang of `POST /api/notifications` did not reproduce after the rebase and its root cause was never isolated). Admin UI placement finalized (§ Admin UI placement). Root `resolutions` additionally pins `websocket-driver@0.7.5` (GHSA-xv26-6w52-cph6, published 2026-07-15; the vulnerable chain exists on upstream `develop` too — see `UPGRADE_NOTES.md`).

### 2026-07-09
- Phase 8 implemented — provider-adapter e2e coverage without live credentials (env-gated in-process SDK-client fakes + JSONL sink; design constraints recorded in § Design Decisions and § Alternatives Considered). Spec restructured onto the spec template; rationale consolidated into § Design Decisions / § Alternatives Considered; every factual claim re-verified against the shipped code.

### 2026-07-06
- Phase 7 implemented — all channels unified on the delivery-strategy seam; `Notification.channels` authoritative; the one intentional corrective behavior change documented in § Migration & Backward Compatibility.

### 2026-07-03
- Push-provider channels made tenant-wide (`channelScope: 'tenant'`); closed a privilege-escalation bypass on the per-user connect route and a cross-org credential-orphaning bug. Companion spec: [`2026-07-03-push-channels-tenant-scope.md`](2026-07-03-push-channels-tenant-scope.md).

### 2026-07-01
- Three org-propagation/decryption blockers found with live FCM keys and fixed; real end-to-end delivery verified against a physical pipeline (API → worker → FCM → device). Companion spec: [`2026-07-01-push-delivery-e2e-findings.md`](2026-07-01-push-delivery-e2e-findings.md).

### 2026-06-26
- Phases 4–6 implemented (provider adapters + token encryption; silent push + flexible payload + type metadata; per-device locale + admin custom send).

### 2026-06-25
- Module 3 re-architected to deliver push through the `communication_channels` hub (FCM/APNs/Expo as hub `ChannelAdapter`s), per maintainer direction on upstream PR #2595; the standalone `PushProvider` interface draft dropped. Verified feasible with no `ChannelAdapter` contract change.

### 2026-04-28
- Initial specification. Verified via `gh search` that no existing upstream issue or PR covers push, devices, preferences, or a persistent type registry.
