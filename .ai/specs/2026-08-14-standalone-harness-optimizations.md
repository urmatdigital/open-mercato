# Standalone Harness Session Resilience & Deterministic Template Gates

**Date**: 2026-08-14
**Status**: Implemented in #5295
**Evidence**: [#5266](https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato/issues/5266) — `opencode-library-task-glm52` session report (OpenCode 1.18.18 + GLM-5.2, high reasoning)

## TLDR

**Key Points:**
- Harden the standalone-app AI harness (`packages/create-app/agentic/**` + `packages/create-app/template/**`) against the failure modes proven by the #5266 session: a quota-killed run left a non-compiling file, a progress ledger that misrepresented eight written files as "not started", a missing migration, one design-token violation, and a session-share report that could not name its own stop cause.
- Two thrusts. **(a) Session resilience:** `om-implement-spec` gains a per-slice ledger-write invariant, a resume/reconciliation contract, and an atomic edit-sequence rule; `om-share-this-session`/`om-judge-agent-session` gain stop-cause extraction and classification. **(b) Deterministic template gates:** the emitted app's `typecheck` gets the same heap headroom its `build` already has, and the template ships `ds:check` and `i18n:check-hardcoded` scripts wired into the validation gate.

**Scope:**
- Per-slice progress ledger invariant + resume reconciliation in `om-implement-spec` (repo-local emitted skill) and the `om-auto-implement-spec` override notes
- Atomic edit-sequence rule (agent-side exhaustion resilience)
- `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192` on the template `typecheck` script, with guard-test parity
- `ds:check` deterministic design-token checker shipped in `template/scripts/`, added to the standalone validation gate
- `i18n:check-hardcoded` checker shipped in `template/scripts/` (advisory first)
- Stop-cause field in `om-share-this-session` bundles/issue template + termination classification in `om-judge-agent-session`
- Framework-lib contract digest (`.ai/guides/framework-contracts.md`) closing the one context gap the implemented read-policy/facts specs do not own

**Concerns:**
- Bundles several independently shippable deliverables; kept in one spec because they share one evidence base (#5266) and one owning surface (the emitted harness), and every phase is individually shippable (see Resolved assumptions).
- The emitted root `AGENTS.md` sits at 10,983 of its 12,288-byte budget — every instruction change in this spec must fit ~1.3 KiB of headroom or trade bytes elsewhere.

## Resolved assumptions (autonomous defaults)

| # | Assumption | Default applied | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | One spec vs split | One spec, four independently shippable phases — **explicit user instruction**; the adversarial scope review recommended SPLIT (boundaries = the four phases) and that recommendation is preserved here for the maintainer | The requester asked for a single spec covering the #5266 optimizations. Phases share no code-level dependencies (verified after the 2026-08-14 review fix: Phase 2 no longer touches `AGENTS.md`), so implementation can still ship one phase — or one split-out spec — per PR without renegotiation. |
| A2 | Where skill changes land | This repo (`packages/create-app/agentic/shared/ai/skills/**`) | `om-implement-spec`, `om-share-this-session`, `om-judge-agent-session`, `om-framework-context` are repo-local core-tier skills per `tiers.json`; only override notes touch the external `om-auto-implement-spec`. No `open-mercato/skills` PR is required. |
| A3 | 429/provider-exhaustion scope | Harness-side mitigations only | The OpenCode runner's retry behavior is out of our control; the harness can only make interruption cheap (continuous ledger, atomic edit sequences, resume contract). |
| A4 | `ds:check` / `i18n:check-hardcoded` severity | `ds:check` hard-fails; `i18n:check-hardcoded` advisory in this spec, promoted later | The DS rules checked are the same ones `writable-ast-oracles.mjs` already hard-fails in harness evals, so app code should meet the same bar; the i18n checker needs an allowlist workflow before it can gate (mirrors the monorepo's Phase-1-advisory precedent in `2026-05-26-missing-translations-audit-and-remediation.md`). |
| A5 | Context-replay ownership | Defer to implemented specs; add only the framework-lib digest | `2026-07-24-standalone-ai-development-harness.md` and `2026-08-01-standalone-harness-example-read-policy.md` own routing, budgets, and bounded `node_modules` reads. The #5266 session's residual gap — shared-lib contracts (CRUD factory hooks, `CommandHandler`, events emit semantics) have no fact sheet, so agents read `node_modules` sources — is the only new deliverable. |
| A6 | Existing scaffolds | New scaffolds get everything; existing apps adopt via upgrade notes | `.ai/agentic.config.json` is registered user-owned/never-overwritten by the harness manifest, so gate changes cannot be force-synced; `om-apply-upgrade-notes` is the adoption path. |

## Overview

The standalone harness is the AI context and skill set emitted into every `create-mercato-app` scaffold. Issue #5266 shared a complete, sanitized OpenCode + GLM-5.2 session implementing a two-phase library spec in such a scaffold. The session is the best full-length field evidence the harness has: one user turn, 115 assistant turns, Phase 1 delivered fully green, and then a hard stop on a provider quota error. The post-mortem (analysis comment on #5266) found the harness — not the model — left recoverable value on the table: the run's death was undetectable from its own report, its progress ledger was stale the moment it mattered, and mechanically detectable DS-token and hardcoded-English defects passed the emitted app's gate.

> **Market reference**: the `om-auto-create-pr-loop` skill in this repo's own automation collection (run folders with a per-step Tasks table, one lean commit per step, checkpoint batching, resume via `om-auto-continue-pr-loop`) is the direct, in-house model for the per-slice ledger and resume contract — adopted. The digest-over-source-reading rule is adopted from the already-implemented read-policy and harness specs rather than re-specified. We reject building a runner-side retry/backoff wrapper: it belongs to OpenCode/Claude-Code upstream, not to an emitted repo harness.

## Problem Statement

Concrete failures from #5266, each mapped to the harness surface that should have absorbed it:

1. **Stale ledger on interruption.** `om-implement-spec`'s planning-and-progress contract already requires recording each slice after it lands, but the run updated the spec's Implementation Status only at the phase boundary. When the 429 hit mid-Phase-2, the ledger said "Loan entity + migration + commands — not started" while eight Phase-2 files existed on disk, one of them non-compiling. A resuming agent trusting the ledger re-does a phase; one trusting the tree misses the broken file. Nothing in the skill defines re-entry at all.
2. **Non-atomic edit sequence.** The final completed tool call removed an import; the statement referencing it (`void bookOptionSchema`) survived in the same file. The two-step removal left the tree broken in the window between edits — exactly where the quota kill landed.
3. **Typecheck OOM is a solved problem the template forgot.** The emitted `build` script carries `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192` (guarded by `template-build-memory.test.ts`); `typecheck` is bare `tsc --noEmit`. The session burned a turn and ~13k reasoning tokens rediscovering the flag — pure waste even for a model that diagnoses it correctly, and a misdiagnosis risk besides.
4. **DS rules are enforced in evals but not in apps.** `writable-ast-oracles.mjs#uiPolicyFailures()` deterministically rejects hardcoded palette classes, arbitrary Tailwind values, and manual `dark:` overrides — for harness eval cases only. The scaffolded app has no `ds:check`; the one starter DS test is stripped by `SKIP_DIRS`. The session shipped `text-amber-600 dark:text-amber-500` and passed the full gate.
5. **Hardcoded user-facing strings pass the gate.** The monorepo has `i18n:check-hardcoded`; the template ships nothing in that direction. The session shipped English-only server-side errors despite the spec requiring localized ones, and the gate stayed green. (The implemented locale-catalog oracle checks the *other* direction: referenced keys → catalogs.)
6. **The share report couldn't name the stop cause.** The #5266 issue says the session "stopped … with an empty final assistant entry"; `session.json` entry 115 plainly records `APIError 429 "Usage limit reached for 5 hour", isRetryable: true`. `om-share-this-session` has no stop-cause field and `om-judge-agent-session` no termination classification, so the single most diagnostic fact of the run was lost to the human reader.
7. **Shared-lib contracts have no digest.** The session read `crud/factory.ts`, `data/engine.ts`, `commands/*`, `events/factory.ts` under `node_modules/@open-mercato/shared` to answer questions ("does the factory double-emit when actions use commands?", "what is the `CommandHandler` shape?", "is there an `afterList` hook?") that are stable, documentable contracts. Module fact sheets exist per enabled module; nothing covers the shared libraries.

## Proposed Solution

Fix each failure at the smallest owning surface, and keep every emitted-knowledge change inside the knowledge-governance contract (failure-first harness case, then the knowledge change, then `harness:validate-knowledge-change`). Enforcement strategy is two-tier and stated honestly: where a script can own the check (heap flag, DS tokens, hardcoded strings, stop-cause extraction) the check is deterministic; where the contract is agent behavior (ledger discipline, resume, atomic edits) it is necessarily prose — so each such rule is written to be *checkable in text* (a completed slice has a ledger line; a resumed run's plan names reconciliation) and gets a harness eval case that fails when the behavior is absent. Prose backed by an eval is weaker than a script but strictly stronger than today's prose backed by nothing.

### Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Ledger-write is part of the slice, not a courtesy after it | "A slice is complete when its ledger line exists" is checkable in text and survives any interruption point; "update the ledger regularly" demonstrably does not. |
| Resume = reconcile, never trust | On re-entry the ledger is a hypothesis; `git status` + focused typecheck are the evidence. Cheapest ordering: typecheck first (finds the broken file from failure mode 2 immediately), then diff tree vs ledger. |
| `ds:check` reuses the oracle's rule family, not the oracle | The eval oracle is controller-owned, 115 KB, and coupled to case plumbing; refactoring it to import external data would risk regressing existing eval cases. Instead `ds-check.mjs` exports its rule table, `template-ds-check.test.ts` asserts semantic parity with the oracle's `uiPolicyFailures` patterns, and the oracle matcher is updated only where the shared arbitrary-token semantics require it. |
| Gate scripts live in `template/scripts/`, not `__tests__` | `SKIP_DIRS` strips `__tests__`/`__integration__` at scaffold time; scripts survive. |
| Stop cause is extracted mechanically in `prepare-share-bundle.mjs` | The last session entry's `info.error` (name, status, message) is data the script already touches during sanitization; classification (`completed` / `provider-limit` / `provider-error` / `user-abort` / `unknown`) is a small closed enum the skill prose maps from it. |
| Framework digest is a static authored guide, not generated | Shared-lib contracts change with platform versions, not with the app's module set; the guide ships versioned with the harness and is refreshed through the normal `om-refresh-standalone-harness` flow when platform PRs change those contracts. |

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Why Rejected |
|-------------|-------------|
| Runner-side 429 retry/backoff wrapper | Owned by OpenCode/Claude Code upstream; an emitted repo cannot intercept its own runner's API loop. |
| Force-syncing `validation.commands` into existing apps | `.ai/agentic.config.json` is user-owned by manifest contract; overwriting user config is a harness law violation. |
| One mega-`om-resume` skill | Resume is not a task type; it is a property of `om-implement-spec`'s contract. A separate skill would duplicate the phase/gate logic it must reconcile against. |
| Extending `uiPolicyFailures()` to also walk app `src/` | Couples the app gate to the eval controller's release cycle and packaging; a shared rule-table test gives alignment without coupling. |

## Architecture

All changes live in `packages/create-app/` and flow to apps through the existing emission pipeline (`copyTree(agentic/shared/ai → .ai/)`, template file copy, harness manifest ownership rules). No monorepo runtime package changes; no `apps/mercato` mirror obligations except where the Template Sync Checklist names a touched file class (only `template/scripts/*` and `package.json.template` here — no `src/app/**` surface is touched).

Contract relationships:

- **Ledger invariant (om-implement-spec).** Slice definition gains: _"A slice is not complete until its `- [x]` ledger line (files, evidence, exact command) is written to the spec's Implementation Status. Write the ledger line before starting the next slice; on any stop mid-slice, append a `- [ ] IN FLIGHT:` line naming files touched so far."_ This makes the ledger's staleness bound one slice, not one phase.
- **Resume contract (om-implement-spec, new reference section).** On invocation where the resolved spec already has an Implementation Status: (1) run the focused typecheck for the in-progress phase **first**; (2) reconcile — `git status`/tree vs ledger; tick slices that verifiably exist and compile, mark broken/partial files in an `IN FLIGHT` line; (3) resume from the first unticked slice. Never re-execute a ticked slice; never trust an unticked one.
- **Atomic edit-sequence rule (om-implement-spec only — deliberately not in the emitted `AGENTS.md`).** _"Paired edits (remove import + remove usage; rename + update call sites within a file) happen in one edit operation. Never end a tool batch with the tree in a known non-compiling state."_ Keeping this out of `AGENTS.md` removes any byte-budget contention between phases: Phase 4 is the only phase that edits `AGENTS.md`.
- **Stop cause (om-share-this-session / om-judge-agent-session).** `prepare-share-bundle.mjs` emits `stopCause: { classification, lastEntryError: { name, statusCode, message } | null }` into `manifest.json`; the issue template gains `## ⏹ Stop cause`; the judge's report template requires a termination line and treats a `provider-limit` stop as context for — never an excuse from — artifact findings.
- **Framework contract digest.** `.ai/guides/framework-contracts.md` (~6–8 KiB) documents: `CommandHandler` (`prepare`/`execute`/`buildLog`) and `registerCommand`; `makeCrudRoute` surface (metadata gates, `list.transformItem`, `hooks.afterList`/`beforeList`, `actions.{create,update,delete}` command wiring, **commands own event emission — the factory does not double-emit**); `runCrudCommandWrite`; `createModuleEvents`/`eventsConfig.emit` post-commit semantics; optimistic-lock helpers (`assertOptimisticLock`, `expected_updated_at`); `readJsonSafe`; DataEngine `create/update/deleteOrmEntity`. Routing: the emitted `AGENTS.md` Axis-2 `framework-context` row points here **before** the bounded `om-framework-context` resolver; the guide links each contract to its exact installed source path so the escape hatch stays one hop away.

## Data Models

No database entities. Changed machine-readable shapes:

- `manifest.json` (share bundle): additive optional `stopCause` object as above; `manifest` consumers (judge input-normalization) treat absence as `unknown` (backward compatible).
- `agentic.config.json` (emitted): `validation.commands` gains `"yarn ds:check"` after `"yarn lint"`. Additive; existing apps unaffected (user-owned file).
- `harness/cases.json` + `validators.json`: new/extended cases and counts per the knowledge-governance workflow (exact case IDs assigned at implementation time by `om-refresh-standalone-harness` conventions; `expectedCaseCount` and family counts updated in the same change).

## API Contracts

None — no HTTP surface changes. CLI surface: two new package scripts in scaffolded apps, `ds:check` and `i18n:check-hardcoded`, both exit-code contracts (0 clean / 1 findings; `i18n:check-hardcoded` exits 0 in advisory mode with a findings summary on stderr). Both accept `--json` for machine consumption by review skills.

## Edge Cases & Failure Scenarios

- **Kill between edit and ledger write:** the slice's `IN FLIGHT` line or the reconciliation typecheck catches it; worst case is re-doing one slice, never a phase.
- **Ledger says done, file deleted/reverted:** reconciliation is tree-authoritative; the tick is removed and the slice re-queued.
- **`ds:check` false positives** (e.g. a legitimate arbitrary value in vendored code): per-file allowlist `.ds-check-ignore` (same shape as the i18n allowlist), each entry requiring a one-line reason; the script fails on allowlist entries that no longer match anything (stale-allowlist rot guard).
- **Heap flag on constrained machines:** `--max-old-space-size=8192` is an upper bound, not a reservation — Node allocates lazily, so small machines are unaffected; the value stays in lockstep with the `build` script via the shared guard test.
- **`AGENTS.md` byte budget overflow:** Phase 4 is the only phase that edits `AGENTS.md` (plus Phase 1's Validation-line word swap), and its routing delta rewrites the existing `framework-context` row rather than adding a new one, so the net byte delta is near zero; the `STANDALONE_ROOT_TARGET_BYTES` test decides, and on overflow the row is shortened until it fits — no other phase's content competes for the budget.
- **Stop-cause extraction on malformed session JSON:** classification falls back to `unknown`; the share flow never blocks on it (the field is additive evidence, not a gate).

## Risks & Impact Review

### Risk Register

| Risk | Category | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Residual |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ds:check` rules drift from the eval oracle's rules | Operational | Medium | Split-brain enforcement (app passes, eval fails) | Create-app semantic-parity fixtures exercise both matchers; any narrow oracle matcher edit ships with focused oracle regression coverage | Low |
| New gate command breaks existing user workflows | Migration | Low | Existing apps' gates unchanged (user-owned config); only new scaffolds affected | UPGRADE_NOTES entry + `om-apply-upgrade-notes` adoption path | Low |
| Knowledge-governance validator burden makes small prose fixes expensive | Operational | Medium | Slower iteration on skill text | The governance contract already exempts byte-identical asset-sync; batch the skill-text changes per phase so one validated knowledge-change covers each | Accepted |
| Ledger discipline inflates token usage per slice | Operational | Low | A ledger line is ~1–2 lines of output per slice — noise vs the 133k/turn replay measured in #5266 | — | Negligible |
| `i18n:check-hardcoded` noise on framework chrome | Operational | Medium | Alert fatigue → checker ignored | Advisory mode + allowlist with reasons; promotion to hard gate is a separate future decision | Accepted |
| Interrupted mid-migration of harness case counts | Data integrity | Low | `harness:validate --all` fails closed until counts, schemas, and cases re-align | Governance validator is the backstop; changes land atomically per phase PR | Low |

Tenant isolation, encryption, and cascading cross-module failures: N/A — no runtime code, no data paths, no PII. The share-bundle `stopCause` field carries provider error text; `prepare-share-bundle.mjs` already sanitizes message strings (the #5266 bundle redacted the reset timestamp inside the 429 message), and `stopCause.message` goes through the same redaction pass.

## Phasing

Each phase is independently shippable and reversible (revert = restore prior emitted text/scripts; no data migrations anywhere).

- **Phase 1 — Template gate hardening** (typecheck heap parity, `ds:check`, `i18n:check-hardcoded`): pure template + emitted-config additions; ships without any skill change.
- **Phase 2 — Session resilience contract** (`om-implement-spec` ledger invariant, resume contract, atomic edits; `om-auto-implement-spec` override note): pure skill-text + harness-case change.
- **Phase 3 — Stop-cause reporting**: `om-share-this-session` script + templates, `om-judge-agent-session` report template.
- **Phase 4 — Framework contract digest**: new guide + `AGENTS.md` routing delta (byte-budget-gated).

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 — Template gate hardening

1. `template/package.json.template`: change `"typecheck"` to `"cross-env NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192 tsc --noEmit"`; extend `packages/create-app/src/lib/template-build-memory.test.ts` to assert the flag on `typecheck` and keep it in lockstep with `build`. _Test: the extended guard test._
2. Add `template/scripts/ds-check.mjs`: scans `src/**/*.{ts,tsx}` (excluding `.mercato`, `node_modules`) for the `uiPolicyFailures` rule family — hardcoded palette/status classes (`/(text|bg|border|ring)-(red|green|emerald|amber|…)-\d{2,3}/`), arbitrary Tailwind values, manual `dark:` overrides on semantic/status tokens, inline `style`, raw `<table>` family tags in backend pages; supports `--json` and `.ds-check-ignore` with stale-entry failure. The script exports its rule table; `template-ds-check.test.ts` asserts semantic parity with the oracle's `uiPolicyFailures` patterns, including negative and bracket-leading arbitrary variants, and the oracle matcher receives the corresponding narrow semantic update. _Test: fixture files with each violation class + a clean fixture; stale-allowlist fixture; semantic rule-parity coverage._
3. Add `"ds:check": "node scripts/ds-check.mjs"` to `package.json.template`; add `"yarn ds:check"` to `agentic/shared/ai/agentic.config.json` `validation.commands` (after `"yarn lint"`); update the emitted `AGENTS.md` Validation line within the byte budget. _Test: `yarn agents:check-budget` equivalent for the standalone target (`STANDALONE_ROOT_TARGET_BYTES` test)._
4. Add `template/scripts/i18n-check-hardcoded.mjs` (advisory): flags string literals in JSX text positions, `label/title/placeholder/aria-label/alt` props, and `Error`/`toast`/`flash` calls outside `t(...)`, honoring the `[internal]` prefix opt-out and a module-scoped allowlist; wire `"i18n:check-hardcoded"` script; do **not** add to `validation.commands`. _Test: fixtures for each detection class + opt-outs._
5. Harness/governance sync: add or extend writable cases so a generated module violating the `ds:check` rule family or shipping hardcoded strings is caught in evals (the oracle already implements the family; cases reference it); run the nine-step knowledge-change workflow + `harness:validate-knowledge-change`. _Test: `yarn harness:validate --all` from a fresh scaffold._
6. UPGRADE_NOTES entry documenting manual adoption for existing apps (scripts + config line), consumable by `om-apply-upgrade-notes`.

### Phase 2 — Session resilience contract

1. `om-implement-spec/references/planning-and-progress.md`: add the ledger-write invariant (ledger line before next slice; `IN FLIGHT` line on mid-slice stop) and the ledger-line format including the exact focused command. _Test: harness routing/decision case asserting the invariant text is loaded for spec-implementation prompts._
2. New `om-implement-spec/references/resume.md` + SKILL.md step: the reconciliation procedure (typecheck-first → tree-vs-ledger reconcile → resume from first unticked slice), including the "never re-execute ticked / never trust unticked" rule; cross-link from `om-auto-implement-spec`'s override notes so the PR-delivery engine inherits it. _Test: writable harness case — fixture scaffold with a seeded half-done Implementation Status + one broken file; oracle asserts the agent's plan names reconciliation before new slices._
3. Atomic edit-sequence rule in `om-implement-spec` SKILL.md rules block (deliberately not in `AGENTS.md` — see Architecture; Phase 4 is the sole `AGENTS.md` owner). _Test: knowledge-governance validator run._

### Phase 3 — Stop-cause reporting

1. `om-share-this-session/scripts/prepare-share-bundle.mjs`: extract the final session entries' `info.error` (name, statusCode, sanitized message) and derive `stopCause.classification ∈ {completed, provider-limit, provider-error, user-abort, unknown}`; write into `manifest.json`; route `message` through the existing redaction pass. _Test: script unit fixtures — a 429 session (expects `provider-limit`), a clean-completion session, a malformed tail (expects `unknown`)._
2. `om-share-this-session` issue template: add `## ⏹ Stop cause` section rendering the classification + sanitized error line; update `references/report-templates.md`. _Test: bundle-preparation fixture snapshot._
3. `om-judge-agent-session/references/report-template.md`: mandatory termination line sourced from `manifest.stopCause` (fallback `unknown` for old bundles); rule text: an interrupted run scopes which acceptance criteria are judgeable, but never converts a found defect into a pass. _Test: judge fixture with the #5266-shaped bundle asserting the report names `provider-limit`._

### Phase 4 — Framework contract digest

1. Author `packages/create-app/agentic/guides/framework-contracts.md` (~6–8 KiB) covering the contracts listed in Architecture, each with its exact installed source path (`node_modules/@open-mercato/shared/src/...`) as the verification hop. _Test: create-app test asserting every named source path exists in the workspace packages (anti-rot)._
2. Emitted `AGENTS.md`: point the Axis-2 `framework-context` row at the guide before the bounded resolver; stay within `STANDALONE_ROOT_TARGET_BYTES`. _Test: byte-budget test + harness routing cases for shared-lib contract questions (e.g. "does makeCrudRoute double-emit with command actions?") resolving to the guide, not `node_modules` reads._
3. Knowledge-governance run (new knowledge owner + source-link inventory rows + case updates). _Test: `harness:validate-knowledge-change` + `yarn harness:validate --all`._

### Testing Strategy

- Unit: `ds-check.mjs` / `i18n-check-hardcoded.mjs` fixture suites; `prepare-share-bundle.mjs` stop-cause fixtures; rule-manifest parity test; source-path anti-rot test; template guard tests (heap flags, byte budget).
- Harness: new/updated routing, decision, and writable cases per phase; `yarn harness:validate --all` green from a fresh scaffold; `harness:validate-knowledge-change` for every knowledge-contract diff.
- No Playwright/UI integration tests: this spec ships no rendered surface (the emitted app's UI is untouched).

## Migration & Compatibility

- All emitted-file changes affect **new scaffolds** on the next create-app release. Existing apps: `.ai/agentic.config.json` and `.ai/lessons.md` are user-owned (never overwritten); skills/guides/harness re-sync through `yarn install-skills` / harness update paths per the existing ownership manifest. UPGRADE_NOTES documents the two manual adoptions (config gate line, package.json script entries).
- `manifest.json` `stopCause` is additive-optional; old bundles remain valid judge inputs (classification `unknown`).
- No BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md contract surface (API routes, DB schema, event IDs, DI keys, import paths) is touched; skill/guide text and template scripts are outside the frozen surfaces. The `validation.commands` addition is additive and lands only in newly emitted configs.
- Rollback per phase = revert the phase's PR; no persisted state anywhere.

- `packages/create-app/AGENTS.md` — Template Sync Checklist, Dev Runtime Expectations
- `.ai/specs/AGENTS.md` — naming, lifecycle, changelog conventions
- `.ai/docs/agent-instructions.md` (routed) — instruction budget contract

### Compliance Matrix

| Rule Source | Rule | Status | Notes |
|-------------|------|--------|-------|
| root AGENTS.md | Check existing specs before modifying a module | Compliant | Overlap audit against 8 prior harness specs recorded in Resolved assumptions A5; owned topics deferred, not re-specified |
| root AGENTS.md | Never edit generated files by hand | Compliant | `design-system-inventory.json` untouched; harness counts updated through the governance workflow |
| root AGENTS.md | Preserve behavior unless a spec asks for change | Compliant | All behavior deltas are this spec's explicit subject |
| create-app AGENTS.md | Template Sync Checklist for `apps/mercato` mirrors | Compliant | No `src/app/**`/env surface touched; `template/scripts/` additions are template-only by design |
| create-app (emitted) | `STANDALONE_ROOT_TARGET_BYTES` 12 KiB budget | Compliant | Byte-budget test gates every `AGENTS.md` edit; explicit overflow fallback defined in Edge Cases |
| knowledge-governance spec | Knowledge-contract changes require failure-first cases + validator | Compliant | Named per phase; batched one validated change per phase |
| root AGENTS.md | No cross-module ORM / tenant scoping / encryption maps | N/A | No runtime entities, queries, or PII columns in scope |
| root AGENTS.md (DS rules) | No hardcoded status colors / arbitrary values | Compliant | The spec's deliverable enforces exactly this; no UI code shipped |
| BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md | Contract surfaces frozen | Compliant | None touched (see Migration & Compatibility) |
| `.ai/qa/AGENTS.md` | Integration coverage listed and shipped in-change | Compliant | Testing Strategy is unit + harness; no API/UI paths exist to cover |

### Internal Consistency Check
Every problem statement (1–7) is owned by exactly one phase, and every phase owns at least one problem (Phase 1 ← problems 3/4/5, Phase 2 ← 1/2, Phase 3 ← 6, Phase 4 ← 7); every phase names its tests; the File Manifest covers every Implementation Plan step; assumptions A1–A6 are each referenced by the section they resolve. `AGENTS.md` has a single owning phase (4), so no cross-phase byte-budget negotiation exists.

Verdict: `Implemented` in #5295. The complete Linux/Bubblewrap release lane was not executed; on 2026-08-14 the maintainer explicitly waived that platform-only lane for this PR after the deterministic harness, package, review, and hosted-CI gates passed.

## Changelog

| Date | Change |
|---|---|
| 2026-08-14 | Initial draft from #5266 session post-mortem; overlap audit vs implemented harness specs; autonomous defaults A1–A6 applied |
| 2026-08-14 | Adversarial fresh-context review applied: SPLIT recommendation recorded in A1 (kept as one per explicit user instruction; phases remain split-ready); removed the cross-phase `AGENTS.md` byte-budget dependency (the framework-digest phase is now sole owner); kept `ds:check` independent of the controller oracle and limited later oracle edits to semantic matcher parity; enforcement two-tier strategy stated honestly; File Manifest completed |
| 2026-08-14 | Implementation #5295: corrected the framework-guide authoring path to the generator-owned `agentic/guides/` surface; added a justified stale-checked DS baseline for the existing template; completed the resilience, stop-cause, contract-digest, and 231-case/49-writable harness changes. The proposed ephemeral integration exit gate was removed at requester direction while retaining the standalone runner's existing general-purpose integration guidance. |
| 2026-08-14 | Maintainer completion decision for #5295: explicitly waived the Linux/Bubblewrap-only complete release lane without claiming it ran; all remaining non-waived exit criteria remain required for merge readiness. |

### Review — 2026-08-14
- **Reviewer**: Agent (fresh-context adversarial subagent, spec file only)
- **Security**: Passed (no runtime surface; stop-cause text routed through existing bundle sanitization)
- **Performance**: Passed (gate additions bounded)
- **Cache**: N/A (no cache usage)
- **Commands**: N/A (no commands/mutations; skill-text contracts only)
- **Risks**: Passed after fixes (oracle-regression risk eliminated by design change; byte-budget contention eliminated)
- **Verdict**: Approved as one spec per explicit requester instruction, with the SPLIT recommendation preserved in A1 for the maintainer
