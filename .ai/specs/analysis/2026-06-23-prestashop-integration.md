# 2026-06-23 — PrestaShop Integration Feasibility

> **Status:** Analysis / Feasibility study (not an implementation spec)
> **Author:** @KramarSellision (community contribution)
> **Date:** 2026-06-23
> **Related analyses:** ANALYSIS-009 (Magento 2), ANALYSIS-005 (Shopify), ANALYSIS-007 (Akeneo PIM)
> **Target platform:** PrestaShop **8.x and 9.x** as primary targets; **PrestaShop 1.7.x as best-effort / requires validation** (Webservice API)

## Executive Summary

This document assesses the feasibility of building a **PrestaShop → Open Mercato** data integration as a future standalone module / community contribution. PrestaShop is a widely deployed open-source PHP e-commerce platform whose **Webservice API** exposes the shop database as a CRUD REST API.

**Overall verdict: FEASIBLE for a read-only import MVP (rough estimate ~80% catalog/customer/order coverage), with a clearly bounded set of caveats.** The strongest fit is the same as for Shopify and Magento: Customers, Catalog (Products + Categories), and Orders map onto existing Open Mercato entities. The recognized platform gap is identical to the other storefront integrations — **Open Mercato has no Inventory module**, so stock levels are explicitly out of scope for the MVP.

The core Webservice resources the MVP relies on (`customers`, `orders`, `products`, `combinations`, `categories`) are listed in the official resource catalog, **but their exact fields and runtime behavior must be validated per supported PrestaShop version** rather than assumed — this is a feasibility assessment, not a confirmed contract.

Two PrestaShop-specific characteristics drive most of the engineering risk:

1. **JSON output does not imply JSON input.** The Webservice can *return* JSON (`output_format=JSON`), but **POST/PUT/PATCH bodies must be XML** (confirmed against official docs: *"As of PrestaShop 8.1, the Webservice is only able to output JSON, it cannot read JSON inputs"*). This does not affect a read-only MVP, but it shapes any future write-back work.
2. **No reliable native delta-sync signal.** PrestaShop has no bulk API and no webhooks in core. Incremental sync depends on `filter[...]` + `date` parameters, and filtering on `date_upd` specifically is **not reliably supported across versions** and **requires validation** (see §2, §7). The MVP therefore ships with **manual, full read-only sync** and treats incremental delta as a follow-up.

Recommendation: proceed with a read-only, manually-triggered, tenant-aware import module built as a dedicated workspace package (`@open-mercato/sync-prestashop`) modeled on `packages/sync-akeneo`. Resolve the Review Questions in §11 before promoting this analysis to an implementation spec.

## 1. Entity Mapping Matrix

Mappings are graded **Direct** (clean 1:1), **Partial** (maps with transformation/loss), or **None** (no Open Mercato equivalent). Field-level details for each resource must be validated against each supported PrestaShop version before implementation.

### 1.1 Customers

| PrestaShop resource | Open Mercato entity | Confidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `customers` | `CustomerEntity` (kind=person) + `CustomerPersonProfile` | Direct | email, firstname, lastname, active |
| `addresses` | `CustomerAddress` | Direct | 1:N; PrestaShop links address → customer via `id_customer` |
| `groups` (customer groups) | `CustomerDictionaryEntry` / custom field | Partial | group semantics differ; map as dictionary or tag |
| `newsletter` / `optin` flags | Custom fields (`ce.ts`) | Partial | marketing consent stored as custom field |

### 1.2 Catalog — Products & Categories

| PrestaShop resource | Open Mercato entity | Confidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `products` | `CatalogProduct` | Direct | name, description (HTML), reference (SKU), active |
| `combinations` | `CatalogProductVariant` | **Partial** | PrestaShop combinations = cartesian product of attribute values; flattening risk (see §4.1) |
| `categories` | `CatalogProductCategory` + `CatalogProductCategoryAssignment` | Direct | tree via `id_parent` |
| `product_option_values` / `product_options` (Attributes) | `CatalogOptionSchemaTemplate` | Partial | drive variant axes |
| `product_features` / `product_feature_values` (Features) | Custom fields (`ce.ts`) | Partial | non-variant descriptive attributes |
| product price (`price`, specific prices) | `CatalogProductPrice` / `CatalogOffer` | Partial | tax-inclusive vs exclusive; specific prices = rules |
| `manufacturers` | Custom field / `CustomerDictionaryEntry` | Partial | no brand entity in OM |
| `suppliers` | Custom field | Partial | no supplier entity in OM |
| product images (`/images/products`) | `Attachment` | Partial | binary download required; not part of MVP core |
| `stock_availables` | — | **None** | no Inventory module (out of scope) |

### 1.3 Orders / Sales

| PrestaShop resource | Open Mercato entity | Confidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `orders` | `SalesOrder` | Direct | reference, total_paid, currency, customer |
| `order_details` (line items) | `SalesOrderLine` | Direct | embedded in order payload |
| order billing/shipping address | `SalesDocumentAddress` | Direct | resolved via `id_address_*` |
| `order_states` + `order_histories` | `SalesOrder.status` + `SalesNote` | Partial | status mapping table required (see §4.5) |
| `order_carriers` / `carriers` | `SalesShippingMethod` | Partial | carrier list maps to shipping methods |
| cart rules / vouchers (`order_cart_rules`) | `SalesOrderAdjustment` | Partial | discount line mapping |
| `order_payments` | `SalesPayment` (record only) | Partial | recorded as payment rows, NOT a live gateway (out of scope) |
| `order_invoices` | — | None (out of scope) | invoices excluded from MVP |
| `order_slips` (credit slips / returns) | — | None (out of scope) | returns excluded from MVP |
| `taxes` / `tax_rules` | `SalesTaxRate` | Partial | preserve original PrestaShop amounts |

### 1.4 Multistore / Channels

| PrestaShop concept | Open Mercato entity | Confidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Shop / Shop Group (multistore) | `SalesChannel` | Partial | optional; MVP may target a single shop |
| Languages (`id_lang` per field) | Translation Manager / locale resolution | Partial | every translatable field is keyed by language id |
| Currencies | `currencyCode` on price/order | Direct | per-order currency available |

## 2. Technical Compatibility

### 2.1 API surface

PrestaShop exposes the **Webservice API** — documented as a **CRUD API** (POST=Create, GET=Read, PUT/PATCH=Update, DELETE=Delete), with one resource per shop entity (`/api/customers`, `/api/orders`, `/api/products`, `/api/combinations`, `/api/categories`, …). These core resources appear in the official resource catalog. **Their exact field sets, optionality, and edge-case behavior are not assumed confirmed here and must be validated per supported version (8.x / 9.x primary; 1.7.x best-effort).**

### 2.2 Authentication

- API key generated in PrestaShop back office (Advanced Parameters → Webservice).
- Sent as **HTTP Basic Auth username with no password** (`Authorization: Basic <base64(key:)>`), or as `?ws_key=` in the URL (less safe). Official docs recommend the Authorization header.
- **No OAuth, no token refresh** — a single long-lived secret. It must be declared as an `IntegrationDefinition` credential field and stored encrypted by the `integrations` module (`IntegrationCredentials`), exactly as Akeneo does — never in `SyncMapping`, which is an unencrypted mapping store (see §6.4).
- Per-resource permissions are configurable in the back office; the integration should document the minimum read scopes it needs and fail the connection test clearly if a resource is forbidden.

### 2.3 Output format

- Default response format is **XML**. **JSON output is available** via `output_format=JSON` or `io_format=JSON` query params, or the `Output-Format: JSON` / `Io-Format: JSON` headers (PrestaShop 1.7+).
- **Critical asymmetry (verified):** JSON output does **not** enable JSON input. POST/PUT/PATCH request bodies must be **XML** (typically obtained from `?schema=blank`, filled, and sent back). This is irrelevant to a read-only MVP but is a hard constraint on any future write-back. The integration should request JSON for reads and must not assume symmetric JSON.

### 2.4 Filtering, pagination, sorting

Confirmed against official "Additional list parameters" docs:

- **Filtering:** `filter[field]=[value]` with operators — intervals `[1,10]`, OR `[1|5]`, begins `[Jo]%`, ends `%[hn]`, contains `%[oh]%`.
- **Display:** `display=full` or `display=[id,name,price]` to limit fields (important for payload size on large catalogs).
- **Pagination:** `limit=[offset,]limit` (e.g. `limit=50` then `limit=50,50`). Offset-based, **not cursor-based** — large catalogs require careful page iteration.
- **Sorting:** `sort=[field_DESC]`, multiple allowed.
- **Date filtering:** filtering/sorting on date fields requires an extra `&date=1` flag. Official examples use **`date_add`**.

### 2.5 Delta / change tracking — REQUIRES VALIDATION

- There is **no bulk API** and **no core webhook system** in PrestaShop. Real-time push is not available without third-party modules.
- Incremental sync would rely on `filter[date_upd]=[from,to]&date=1`. **However, filtering on `date_upd` is reported as unreliable / unsupported in several PrestaShop versions** — the field is treated as "dynamic" and rejected for GET filtering in some releases (PrestaShop issues #14606, #12385). **This MUST be validated against each supported PrestaShop version before being relied upon.**
- **Consequence for the MVP:** ship **manual full read-only sync** first; treat `date_upd`-based incremental sync as a follow-up gated on the validation above. `date_add` filtering is a more reliable fallback for "new since" scenarios but does not capture updates.

### 2.6 Rate limits

PrestaShop core imposes **no documented rate limit**; throughput is bounded by the merchant's hosting. The client must therefore self-throttle (bounded concurrency, exponential backoff on 5xx/timeouts) to avoid overloading small shops — reuse the Akeneo client's backoff approach.

## 3. What Works Well (Low Risk)

- **Stable, documented CRUD read API.** GET on every needed resource, with field selection (`display`) and basic filtering.
- **Customers and Categories** map closely onto Open Mercato entities.
- **Orders with line items** are retrievable with billing/shipping addresses and totals, sufficient for read-only order ingestion.
- **JSON reads** remove XML-parsing burden for the import path (the constrained side, XML input, is out of scope for the MVP).
- **Field selection + pagination** let the importer keep payloads small and resumable.
- **Architecture parity:** the read-only, adapter-based, queue-driven, reconcilable import pattern from `packages/sync-akeneo` transfers almost directly.
- **No OAuth dance:** a single API key simplifies the connection-test and credential flow.

## 4. Key Challenges / Gaps

### 4.1 Combinations → Variants flattening (Partial, MEDIUM/HIGH)

PrestaShop **combinations** are generated from the cartesian product of attribute values attached to a product. Mapping to `CatalogProductVariant` requires:

- resolving each combination's attribute axes via `product_option_values`,
- deduplicating shared attribute definitions,
- handling products with **zero combinations** (simple products) vs many.

**MVP stance:** import combinations as variants in a **limited** form (basic axis + SKU + price + barcode), or, if core-team review shows the axis resolution is too costly, ship **simple products only** in v1 and treat combinations as an explicit, documented follow-up. Store the original PrestaShop combination payload in metadata for later enrichment.

### 4.2 Attributes vs Features (Partial, MEDIUM)

PrestaShop has **two** distinct attribute systems: **Attributes** (drive combinations / variant axes) and **Features** (descriptive, non-variant). They must be routed to different Open Mercato targets — Attributes → option schema, Features → custom fields — and conflating them produces wrong variant matrices.

### 4.3 Multilingual fields (Partial, MEDIUM)

Translatable fields (`name`, `description`, …) are returned as **per-language arrays keyed by `id_lang`**. The importer needs a locale-resolution strategy (a preferred language with fallback, analogous to Akeneo's `readPreferredAkeneoValue` in `packages/sync-akeneo/src/modules/sync_akeneo/lib/catalog-importer.ts`) plus a mapping from each PrestaShop language id to the corresponding Open Mercato locale, so that translated values land on the correct Open Mercato locale (via the Translation Manager) and a default locale is always chosen when a translation is missing.

### 4.4 Price model differences (Partial, MEDIUM)

PrestaShop prices can be tax-included or tax-excluded, and **specific prices** are rule-based (per group/country/quantity/date). The MVP should import the **base price** only and preserve original amounts; specific-price rules are a follow-up.

### 4.5 Order status mapping (Partial, MEDIUM)

`order_states` are merchant-configurable (including custom states). A **configurable mapping table** (PrestaShop state id/name → Open Mercato `SalesOrder.status`) is required, with a safe default and a way to surface unmapped states in the sync log rather than silently dropping them.

### 4.6 No native delta + offset pagination (HIGH for incremental)

As described in §2.4/§2.5: no webhooks, no bulk API, unreliable `date_upd` filtering, and offset-only pagination make robust incremental sync non-trivial. This is the main reason the MVP is scoped to **manual full read-only sync**.

### 4.7 Deletion detection (MEDIUM)

The API gives no "deleted since" signal. Detecting records removed in PrestaShop requires **full ID reconciliation** (compare imported external IDs against the current PrestaShop ID set, then deactivate the missing ones) — the same reconciliation pattern Akeneo uses. Because that pass is destructive, it is gated on a fully successful sync and bounded by a deactivation threshold; see §7.1 steps 5–6.

### 4.8 Version drift (MEDIUM)

Behavior differs across PrestaShop versions (e.g. JSON output availability, `date_upd` filtering, resource fields). The MVP targets **8.x and 9.x as primary**, with **1.7.x as best-effort pending validation**, and must validate assumptions per supported version.

## 5. Framework Gaps (Open Mercato side)

These are gaps in Open Mercato, not PrestaShop, and are **shared with the Shopify/Magento analyses**:

- **No Inventory module (Critical, shared gap).** `stock_availables` has no home. **Out of scope for the MVP**; revisit when a platform Inventory module exists.
- **No brand/manufacturer or supplier entity.** Map to custom fields / dictionary entries for now.
- **No DAM / media-management module.** Product image binaries can be stored as `Attachment`, but there is no rich media model; images are excluded from the MVP core.
- **Custom-field translations.** Open Mercato custom fields are not natively multilingual; non-default-locale values may need to be stored in metadata (same limitation noted for Akeneo).
- **Returns / credit slips and invoices** have partial sales-document support but are intentionally out of MVP scope.

None of these block the MVP; they bound it.

## 6. Proposed Implementation Architecture

> Architecture sketch only — concrete contracts belong in the follow-up implementation spec.

### 6.1 Packaging

Build a **dedicated workspace package** `@open-mercato/sync-prestashop` (module id `sync_prestashop`), **not** an app-level module. Rationale (per project conventions and the Step-4 comparison): the integration has an external HTTP API, complex N-way mapping, credentials + health check, queues/workers, and an independent release lifecycle — exactly the `packages/sync-akeneo` profile, and far beyond the in-process `example_customers_sync` 1:1 pattern. Provider integrations must live under `packages/`, never in `packages/core`.

### 6.2 Module layout (mirrors `sync-akeneo`)

```text
packages/sync-prestashop/
  src/modules/sync_prestashop/
    index.ts                 # module metadata; requires: integrations, data_sync, catalog, sales, customers
    di.ts                    # registerDataSyncAdapter(...), register health check
    integration.ts           # IntegrationDefinition: credentials (baseUrl, apiKey), category 'data_sync'
    setup.ts                 # optional env preset, default mappings
    lib/
      client.ts              # Webservice client: Basic auth, JSON reads, filter/limit/sort, backoff, host allowlist
      adapter.ts             # DataSyncAdapter implementation (entry point)
      importer.ts            # transform + upsert per entity (customers, categories, products, orders)
      mapping.ts             # load/resolve field + status mappings from SyncMapping
      cursor.ts              # offset serialization only; persistence uses core SyncCursor
      status-map.ts          # PrestaShop order_state -> SalesOrder.status
      first-import.ts        # orchestration: categories -> products -> customers -> orders
    workers/
      first-import.ts        # queued full-sync worker with ProgressService
    api/
      first-import/route.ts  # POST trigger + GET status (manual sync)
      discovery/route.ts     # connection test + metadata (languages, order states) for UI
    data/validators.ts       # zod schemas for discovery/config payloads
    i18n/                    # en, pl, es, de
```

**Reuse, not redeclaration.** Like `sync-akeneo`, the package ships **no `acl.ts`**: it consumes the existing `data_sync.view` / `data_sync.run` / `data_sync.configure` features owned by `packages/core/src/modules/data_sync/acl.ts`, and would only declare its own features if it needed a scope `data_sync` does not define. Run bookkeeping and cursor persistence likewise reuse the platform entities in `packages/core/src/modules/data_sync/data/entities.ts` — `SyncRun` (status plus `createdCount` / `updatedCount` / `skippedCount` / `failedCount` / `batchesCompleted` / `lastError` / `progressJobId`) and `SyncCursor` (per `{integrationId, entityType, direction, organizationId, tenantId}`) — rather than introducing a parallel sync-log or cursor table.

### 6.3 Connection test

A discovery/health endpoint that calls a cheap authenticated GET (e.g. `/api/?output_format=JSON` or `/api/customers?limit=1`) to verify base URL + API key + resource permissions, returning a clear pass/fail with the failing resource named.

### 6.4 Tenant-aware, encrypted config

Two distinct stores, and they must not be conflated:

- **Credentials** (`baseUrl`, `apiKey`) are declared as `credentials.fields` on the `IntegrationDefinition` (`integration.ts`) and persisted by the `integrations` module in `IntegrationCredentials` (table `integration_credentials`), per `{ tenantId, organizationId }`. That field is the one covered by an encryption map (`integrations/encryption.ts` registers `integrations:integration_credentials` → `credentials`), and the adapter receives the decrypted values as `input.credentials` — identical to `sync-akeneo`, which never reads a secret out of a mapping row.
- **Field and status mappings** are persisted per `{ tenantId, organizationId }` in `SyncMapping` (table `sync_mappings`). Its `mapping` column is **plain JSON and is not encrypted** — the `data_sync` module ships no encryption map — so it must never hold an API key, password, or any other secret.

All writes scoped by tenant/org; no cross-tenant data exposure.

### 6.5 Duplicate protection

Every imported record carries its **PrestaShop external id** (resource + id). Upserts key on `(integrationId, entityType, externalId)` so re-running a sync updates in place rather than duplicating — the same external-id keyed upsert Akeneo uses.

## 7. Data Sync Strategy

### 7.1 MVP — manual, full, read-only import

1. **Trigger:** user clicks "Sync now" (manual) → enqueues a single full-import job (concurrency 1), tracked via `ProgressService`.
2. **Order of operations (respect dependencies):** `categories → products (+ combinations, limited or deferred per review) → customers → orders`.
3. **Read path:** JSON output, `display=[…]` to trim payloads, `limit` offset pagination, bounded concurrency + backoff.
4. **Upsert:** transform → external-id keyed create/update; record every decision.
5. **Reconciliation — gated on a fully successful pass.** Compare PrestaShop IDs vs imported IDs and deactivate records missing upstream (deletion detection), **only when every page of every entity in the pass completed successfully**. On any partial failure — a timeout, a 5xx, an expired key, an unreadable page — reconciliation is **skipped entirely**, the run is marked incomplete (`SyncRun.status = 'failed'`, `failedCount > 0`), and the reason is surfaced in the sync log. Reconciling the output of an incomplete import would read the un-fetched remainder as "deleted upstream" and mass-deactivate live catalogue, customer, or order records; §7.4 makes the MVP manual-only, so nobody would be watching when it happened.
6. **Blast-radius guard on deactivation.** Even after a successful pass, refuse to deactivate when the missing set exceeds a configurable share of the imported set (a conservative default — e.g. 10% — is enough for the MVP). Exceeding it fails the run with a clear error and deactivates nothing, so a silently truncated upstream response cannot empty a catalogue.
7. **Resume semantics.** A run that fails midway is resumable from the stored `SyncCursor` offset for the entity it died on; entities already completed in that run are not re-fetched. A resumed run only qualifies as "fully successful" for step 5 once every entity has completed within it. Restarting from zero is always permitted and is the fallback when the stored offset is stale (e.g. the upstream page size or sort order changed), since offset pagination is not stable across upstream mutations.

### 7.2 Sync log / error log

Persist a per-run record on the platform's existing `SyncRun` entity (counts created/updated/skipped/failed, per-entity progress, errors with the offending external id and reason) — no bespoke sync-log table. Its `status` and `failedCount` are what §7.1 step 5 reads to decide whether reconciliation may run at all, so every partial failure MUST be recorded there rather than only logged. Unmapped order states and skipped/limited combinations are logged explicitly rather than silently dropped. Surface in the integration UI.

### 7.3 Incremental sync (follow-up, gated)

Only after validating `date_upd` (or falling back to `date_add` "new since") per supported version: add an incremental mode using `filter[date_upd]=[from,to]&date=1` and a stored high-water mark. Until then, "incremental" = re-run full sync.

### 7.4 Scheduling

MVP is **manual only**. Automated scheduling (cron/queue cadence) and any real-time strategy are out of scope.

## 8. Implementation Phasing + Effort

Estimates are rough, for sequencing only (not a task breakdown).

| Phase | Scope | Rough effort |
|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1 — MVP (read-only)** | Package scaffold; Webservice client (auth, JSON reads, filter/limit/sort, backoff); connection test; manual full sync; **Customers + Categories + Products + Orders** with order status mapping; **Combinations/variants as a limited import or an explicit follow-up, per core-team review**; external-id dedupe; tenant-aware encrypted config; sync/error log; success-gated reconciliation/deletion detection with a deactivation blast-radius guard. **Out of scope:** inventory/stock, write-back, invoices, returns, webhooks, advanced scheduler. | ~3–5 weeks |
| **Phase 2 — Incremental & enrichment** | `date_upd`/`date_add` delta (after validation); specific prices; manufacturers/suppliers; product images → `Attachment`; multilingual field resolution polish; multistore → channels | ~2–4 weeks |
| **Phase 3 — Advanced (optional)** | Scheduled sync; write-back (requires XML POST/PUT path); payments/invoices/returns once platform support exists; Inventory once a platform Inventory module exists | gated on platform work |

## 9. Risk Matrix

| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `date_upd` filtering unsupported/unreliable across versions | High | High | **Validate per version**; MVP uses manual full sync; fall back to `date_add` for "new since" |
| No Inventory module in Open Mercato | High | Certain | Stock out of scope for MVP; revisit when platform Inventory exists |
| Combinations → variants flattening is complex/expensive | Medium/High | Medium | Limited combination import in v1, or simple-products-only with combinations as documented follow-up |
| Offset pagination + large catalogs → slow/heavy full syncs | Medium | High | `display` field trimming, bounded concurrency, progress tracking, resumable jobs |
| No native delta / no webhooks | High | Certain | Manual full sync + reconciliation in MVP; incremental as gated follow-up |
| Order-state mapping gaps (custom states) | Medium | High | Configurable status map + safe default + log unmapped states |
| Attributes vs Features conflated | Medium | Medium | Explicit routing: Attributes→option schema, Features→custom fields |
| Multilingual `id_lang` field handling | Medium | High | Locale-resolution strategy + PrestaShop-language → Open Mercato-locale mapping |
| Resource field/behavior differs from assumptions | Medium | Medium | Validate fields per supported version before implementation |
| API key compromised (single long-lived secret) | Medium | Low | Encrypted storage, host allowlist, least-privilege resource scopes |
| No rate limit → overload small shops | Medium | Medium | Self-throttle: bounded concurrency + exponential backoff |
| Version drift (8.x/9.x primary, 1.7.x best-effort) | Medium | Medium | Declare supported versions; validate per version |
| Deletion detection only via full reconciliation | Medium | High | Full ID reconciliation pass **only after a fully successful sync** (§7.1 step 5); skipped on any partial failure |
| Reconciliation after a partial sync mass-deactivates live records | High | Medium | Gate reconciliation on a fully successful pass; blast-radius guard capping the deactivatable share; incomplete runs marked failed on `SyncRun` |
| Long-lived API key persisted in an unencrypted store | High | Low | Credentials only in `IntegrationCredentials` (encrypted); `SyncMapping` holds mappings, never secrets (§6.4) |
| Future write-back requires XML input (no JSON input) | Low (MVP) | Certain | Out of MVP scope; design XML POST/PUT path only if Phase 3 write-back is approved |

## 10. Verdict & Recommendations

**Verdict: FEASIBLE — proceed with a read-only, manual, tenant-aware MVP.**

- The Customers / Catalog / Orders core maps onto Open Mercato well enough to deliver real value in a read-only import, and the engineering pattern is a near-direct reuse of `sync-akeneo`.
- The MVP scope deliberately excludes the hard/blocked areas (inventory, write-back, webhooks, invoices, payments-as-gateway, returns, advanced scheduler, full migration), keeping risk bounded.
- The two genuinely PrestaShop-specific risks — **XML-only input** and **unreliable `date_upd` delta** — do not affect a read-only manual MVP and are explicitly deferred.

**Recommended approach:**

1. Build `@open-mercato/sync-prestashop` as a workspace package modeled on `sync-akeneo`.
2. Ship Phase 1 (read-only, manual, full sync) with external-id dedupe, status mapping, reconciliation, and a sync/error log; decide combinations scope (limited vs follow-up) via core-team review.
3. **Before** Phase 2, validate `date_upd` filtering against each supported PrestaShop version; only then build incremental sync.
4. Keep this document as a feasibility analysis; create a separate implementation spec (`.ai/specs/{date}-prestashop-sync-mvp.md`) once the Review Questions below are resolved. That spec MUST carry an **integration coverage** section naming the tests that ship with the implementation — per root `AGENTS.md`, at minimum both API routes defined in §6.2 (`api/first-import/route.ts`, `api/discovery/route.ts`) plus the reconciliation gate and blast-radius guard from §7.1, which are the failure paths most expensive to discover in production. Test strategy is deliberately out of scope for this analysis, but it is not optional for the spec that follows it.

**Out of scope for the MVP (by design):** bidirectional/write-back sync, inventory/stock, invoices, payment gateway, returns, webhooks, advanced scheduler, full shop migration.

## 11. Review Questions for Open Mercato Core Team

1. **Combinations scope:** For v1, do we ship **limited combination→variant import**, or **simple products only** with combinations as a documented follow-up?
2. **Supported PrestaShop versions:** Confirm the target matrix (proposed: 8.x and 9.x primary, 1.7.x best-effort). Is 1.7.x support required given its weaker JSON/filter behavior?
3. **`date_upd` validation owner:** Who validates `date_upd` filtering per version, and is `date_add`-based "new since" an acceptable interim until that's confirmed?
4. **Order status mapping:** Should the PrestaShop `order_state → SalesOrder.status` map be a shipped default, fully merchant-configurable in the UI, or both?
5. **Manufacturers/suppliers:** Acceptable to land these as custom fields / dictionary entries for now, or is a brand/supplier entity on the platform roadmap?
6. **Images:** Are product images in or out of the MVP? If in, confirm `Attachment` is the right sink and acceptable bandwidth cost.
7. **Multistore:** Does the MVP target a single shop, or must it handle multistore → `SalesChannel` from day one?
8. **Inventory dependency:** Confirm stock stays out until a platform Inventory module exists, matching the Shopify/Magento decision.
9. **Connection-test scope:** Minimum resource permissions the connection test must verify?
10. **Module home:** Confirm this ships as `@open-mercato/sync-prestashop` (workspace package), consistent with the provider-package convention, rather than an app-level module.
11. **Deactivation blast-radius threshold:** §7.1 step 6 proposes refusing reconciliation-driven deactivation above a configurable share of the imported set (default 10%). Confirm the default, and whether exceeding it should fail the run outright or deactivate nothing and warn.
