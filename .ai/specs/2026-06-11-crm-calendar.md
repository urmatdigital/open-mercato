# CRM Calendar — full-page Day/Week/Month/Agenda views over customer interactions

## TLDR
**Key Points:**
- A new full-page admin Calendar at `/backend/calendar` (sidebar: first item of the **Customers** group — see UI/UX adaptations; the mockup's "General" group does not exist in the app shell) that renders existing `CustomerInteraction` records — meetings, calls, events, tasks — in four switchable views: **Day, Week, Month, Agenda**.
- Pixel-faithful implementation of the UX mockups in Figma file `oTF1oZoaNgFUdtmxEX2oSc` (*SPEC-048 CRM Detail Pages UX Mockup*), page **Calendar** (`1759:723`): Week `1759:6779`, Day `1761:7917`, Month `1761:8607`, Agenda `1761:9420`.
- **No new entity, no new API route, no schema change.** The calendar is a read view + create/edit dialog over the canonical interactions model (SPEC-046b) and its existing `/api/customers/interactions` route. Issue #4735 adds an optional `recurrenceMasters=true` list filter so the client can fetch series masters that started before the visible `from` boundary without changing default range-query behavior.

**Scope:**
- Calendar page scaffold: header (dynamic title + subtitle + "New event" CTA), toolbar (Today, range presets, jump-to-date range chip, search, filter), category tabs (All Scheduled / Meetings / Events), view switcher (Day | Week | Month | Agenda), shortcuts/timezone footer.
- Week & Day time-grid views with overlap-packing event blocks (title, time, participant avatars, meeting-platform chip, venue/link line), muted past/done styling, hatched non-working day columns.
- Month grid with per-type colored pills and `+N more` overflow; Agenda view with day-grouped rows (time, color bar, title, `Type · Location`, avatars, type badge).
- Upcoming highlight cards (next 4 upcoming items) with status variants: live/today + Join link, conflicted, cancelled, future.
- Conflict surfacing: client-side overlap pairs for grid badges/cards.
- Create/edit via a new **`CalendarEventEditor`** implementing the designer's six typed editor modals (Figma frames `1771:11122/11220/11309/11384/11423/11521` — Meeting/Call/Email/Note/Event/Task variants of one "New event" modal with a type switcher and per-type fields), submitting through the existing interactions API with `useGuardedMutation` + optimistic-lock headers. `ScheduleActivityDialog` (detail pages) ships untouched. Keyboard shortcuts (`T D W M A N / ?`), timezone indicator.

**Concerns (if any):**
- The mockups carry a few design-template artifacts (header CTAs "Schedule" / "Create Request", backward-looking "Last 7 days" preset, 5-column week). Resolved adaptations are documented in **UI/UX → Documented mockup adaptations** — visual style is preserved, semantics are made calendar-correct.
- Month view at scale: list API caps pages at 100 items; the data hook follows cursors with a hard cap (see Risks).

## Overview
CRM users plan their day around scheduled touchpoints — meetings, calls, demos, tasks. Open Mercato already stores all of these as canonical `CustomerInteraction` records (SPEC-046b) with scheduling fields (`scheduledAt`, `durationMinutes`, `allDay`, `location`, `participants`, `status`, `recurrenceRule`), but the only calendar surfaces are per-customer detail widgets (`MiniWeekCalendar`, `ActivitiesDayStrip`). There is no place to see *everything scheduled* across the CRM. This spec adds that page, following UX mockups prepared by the design team after business consultation.

> **Market Reference**: Studied **Odoo CRM** (open-source leader: activity calendar with day/week/month views, type-colored entries, click-to-create) and **Pipedrive's Activities calendar** / **HubSpot Meetings** (commercial canon: activity types, linked contacts/deals, conference-platform chips, conflict hints). Adopted: type-driven colors, view switcher incl. agenda, quick create, "effective date" semantics (done → occurred, planned → scheduled). Rejected: drag-and-drop rescheduling and external calendar sync (Google/Outlook) — neither appears in the mockups; sync belongs to the integrations framework as a future provider package.

## Problem Statement
- Scheduled CRM work is invisible outside individual customer detail pages; users cannot answer "what is happening this week?" without opening records one by one.
- Planned interactions cannot be reviewed per day/week/month, so double-bookings (same owner or participant, overlapping times) go unnoticed.
- Creating a scheduled interaction requires navigating into a specific customer first.

## Proposed Solution
A single new backend page in the **customers module** (which owns the data) — `packages/core/src/modules/customers/backend/calendar/page.tsx` → route `/backend/calendar` — registered as the first item of the **Customers** sidebar group. A thin server `page.tsx` renders a client `CalendarScreen` island that:
1. Computes the visible range from `view + anchorDate` (day/week/month) or an agenda horizon (default next 7 days).
2. Fetches interactions for the range via the existing `GET /api/customers/interactions?from&to` and, in parallel, overlapping recurring masters via the additive `recurrenceMasters=true` filter (cursor-following, `apiCall`); the shared `fetchCalendarCandidates` helper is used by both the grid and the editor conflict probe, deduplicates both result sets by interaction id, and preserves recurring masters in the combined cap before expansion. Org/tenant scoping remains enforced server-side.
3. Derives everything else client-side: category tab counts, conflict pairs, recurrence expansion within the window, upcoming cards.
4. Renders the active view with hand-rolled, DS-token-compliant components that match the Figma mockups.

### Design Decisions
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Page lives in `customers` module | The data is `CustomerInteraction`; placing the page in its owning module avoids cross-module ORM access and keeps the module self-contained. Sidebar: `pageGroup: 'Customers'` with the lowest `pageOrder` in the group — the mockup's "General" group does not exist (no Dashboard sidebar item either; group order is hardcoded in `normalizeGroupWeights()`, `auth/lib/backendChrome.tsx`), and adding one would touch shared auth chrome for zero functional gain. |
| Reuse `CustomerInteraction` + existing API | Fields map 1:1 to the mockups (type, schedule, duration, all-day, location, participants, status, recurrence). Default `from`/`to` filtering on `coalesce(occurred_at, scheduled_at, created_at)` remains unchanged. The additive `recurrenceMasters=true` mode uses the same effective anchor for its upper bound and selects recurring rows with `coalesce(occurred_at, scheduled_at, created_at) <= to` and no end before `from`, allowing client-side expansion in future windows without altering existing callers. |
| Hand-rolled view components (no `react-big-calendar`) | Pixel fidelity + DS-token compliance are incompatible with overriding rbc's stylesheet (its CSS was already demoted to a lazy chunk for perf, PR #2856). The existing `ScheduleCalendar` stays untouched for staff scheduling; its `ScheduleItem` model (availability/exception kinds) does not fit interaction rendering (avatars, platform chips, category pills). Week/day overlap packing is a well-understood column-packing algorithm (~80 LOC, unit-tested). |
| Conflict badges and calendar-editor probe client-side | Grid/card badges need all-pairs detection over the visible window (trivial client-side, ≤ a few hundred items). The editor expands the same shared candidate set and applies `findEditorConflictItems` for its save-time warning, while the existing `/api/customers/interactions/conflicts` endpoint remains unchanged for `ScheduleActivityDialog`. |
| Create/edit via a new `CalendarEventEditor` (designer-specified) | The 2026-06-12 Figma revision added six explicit "Event editor" modal mockups — one unified modal with a Meeting/Call/Email/Note/Event/Task switcher and per-type field morphology (Starts+Ends vs When vs Sent vs Logged vs Due; Location vs Phone/link; Attendees vs To vs single Assignee; Task-only Priority). Restyling the shared `ScheduleActivityDialog` to this design would mutate a maintained detail-page component for zero detail-page benefit; the calendar gets its own editor that submits via the SAME API/commands (`useGuardedMutation`, lock header, conflict check). The earlier plan to extend `ScheduleActivityDialog` was superseded and reverted. |
| Editor field → interaction mapping | `title`←Title/Subject/Note; `entityId`←Related-to person/company (required); `dealId`←Related-to deal chip (optional); `allDay`; `scheduledAt`←Starts/When/Sent/Logged/Due (+time); `durationMinutes`←Ends−Starts (types with an end); `recurrenceRule`←Repeat (Weekly+BYDAY+Never/On date/After ⇒ UNTIL/COUNT — exactly the platform's existing producer subset); `interactionType`←Category dictionary entry when picked, else the active tab kind; `location`←Location/Phone-link; `participants`←Attendees/To (staff + customer contacts per validator support); `ownerUserId`←Task Assignee; `priority`←Task Priority; `body`←Description. All creates are `status: 'planned'` at the chosen datetime. |
| Seed an `event` activity type (additive) | Tabs split Meetings vs Events; `ACTIVITY_TYPE_DEFAULTS` (in `cli.ts`, consumed by `seedCustomerDictionaries`) has no `event` entry. Seeding one (idempotent, additive, appearance color distinct from the existing palette — note `meeting` already owns amber `#f59e0b`) makes the Events tab meaningful on fresh tenants without affecting existing data. Mockup tint colors are illustrative; runtime colors always come from the tenant's dictionary. |

### Alternatives Considered
| Alternative | Why Rejected |
|-------------|-------------|
| New standalone `calendar` module | Would either duplicate interaction storage or read another module's entity; a view-only module owning no data fails the "modules own their data" smell test and adds DI/ACL/setup surface for zero data value. |
| New `calendar_events` entity | Splits scheduling state into a second source of truth; contradicts SPEC-046b unification which just consolidated activities/todos into interactions. |
| Extending `ScheduleCalendar` (react-big-calendar) | See Design Decisions — CSS override surface, model mismatch, perf regression risk on a shared component used by staff module. |
| Dynamic tab-per-dictionary-type | Mockups fix three tabs (All Scheduled / Meetings / Events); a type→category mapping keeps mockup parity and tolerates custom tenant types (unmapped types appear under All Scheduled). |

## User Stories / Use Cases
- **A sales rep** wants to **see this week's meetings and tasks in a time grid** so that **they can prepare for each appointment**.
- **A sales manager** wants to **spot overlapping meetings for their team** so that **double-bookings get resolved before they happen**.
- **A CRM user** wants to **create a scheduled meeting from the calendar** (picking the related person/company) so that **they don't have to navigate to the customer record first**.
- **A user** wants to **switch Day/Week/Month/Agenda with keyboard shortcuts** so that **navigation is instant**.

## Architecture
```
/backend/calendar (server page.tsx — metadata, translations, shell)
  └─ CalendarScreen ("use client")
       ├─ state: view (day|week|month|agenda), anchorDate, agendaHorizon, tab, search, filters
       ├─ useCalendarItems(range)
       │     └─ fetchCalendarCandidates(range)  (shared with editor conflict probe)
       │           ├─ GET /api/customers/interactions?from&to (+cursor follow)
       │           ├─ GET /api/customers/interactions?from&to&recurrenceMasters=true (+cursor follow)
       │           └─ dedupe by id, masters first within cap → expandRecurrences(items, range)
       ├─ derive: categories • tabCounts • conflicts • upcomingCards • client search
       ├─ <CalendarHeader/> <CalendarToolbar/> <UpcomingCards/> <CalendarTabs/>
       ├─ view === week|day → <TimeGrid days={1|7}/>   (overlap packing)
       ├─ view === month    → <MonthGrid/>             (pills + "+N more")
       ├─ view === agenda   → <AgendaList/>            (day-grouped rows)
       ├─ <CalendarFooter/> (shortcuts legend + timezone)
       └─ <CalendarEventEditor/> (lazy; six-type modal per Figma 1771:111xx; useGuardedMutation + lock header)
```
Data flow is read-mostly; the only writes go through the existing interactions API (command bus → undo/audit, events `customers.interaction.*` emitted as today). No new commands, no new events, no widget spots, no DI registrations.

### Commands & Events
- Reused, not new: command ids `customers.interactions.create` / `.update` (via POST/PUT route); events already emitted by those commands. The calendar adds **no** new command or event ids.

## Data Models
**No new entities. No migrations.** Read model is `CustomerInteraction` (`packages/core/src/modules/customers/data/entities.ts`): `interactionType`, `title`, `status` (`planned|done|canceled`), `scheduledAt`, `occurredAt`, `durationMinutes`, `allDay`, `location`, `participants` (`{userId,name?,email?,status?}[]`), `recurrenceRule`, `recurrenceEnd`, `appearanceIcon`, `appearanceColor`, `ownerUserId`, `entityId`, `dealId`, `updatedAt`.

### Derived (client-side, pure functions in `lib/calendar/`)
- **Effective start**: `occurredAt ?? scheduledAt` (items with neither are excluded from all calendar views — an interaction without any date has no calendar placement; the API's `createdAt` coalesce only affects which rows are fetched).
- **Effective end**: `start + durationMinutes` (default 30 min when null); `allDay` items render in the all-day lane (week/day) / as pills (month).
- **Category mapping** (`interactionType` → tab/badge): `meeting, call, video-call → meeting`; `event, webinar → event`; `task, todo, deadline → task`; anything else → `other` (All Scheduled only). Mapping is a plain exported const so tenants' custom types degrade gracefully.
- **Conflict**: two items conflict when both are non-`canceled`, time ranges overlap, and they share `ownerUserId` or any `participants[].userId`. Computed over loaded window + upcoming-cards items.
- **Type color**: dictionary `appearanceColor` for the type (fallback chain: item `appearanceColor` → dictionary entry color → neutral).

### Seed addition (additive, idempotent)
`ACTIVITY_TYPE_DEFAULTS` (`packages/core/src/modules/customers/cli.ts`, consumed by `seedCustomerDictionaries`) gains an `event` entry in the `activity-types` dictionary (label "Event", appearance color distinct from existing defaults — `meeting` already owns amber `#f59e0b`) — only inserted when absent, same pattern as existing seeded types. `setup.ts` itself is unchanged.

## API Contracts
**No new endpoints.** Usage contract of the existing routes:
### List interactions for a range
- `GET /api/customers/interactions?from=<iso>&to=<iso>&limit=100[&cursor=…][&interactionType=…][&status=…]`
- `from` is sent padded by −1 day to catch items spanning midnight into the range.
- Client follows `nextCursor` (response shape `{ items, nextCursor }`) until exhausted or a hard cap of **500 items** per window (then a non-blocking notice "Showing first 500 items for this range" — see Risks).
- In parallel, the calendar sends the same window with `recurrenceMasters=true`. This opt-in mode returns rows where `recurrence_rule IS NOT NULL`, `coalesce(occurred_at, scheduled_at, created_at) <= to`, and `recurrence_end IS NULL OR recurrence_end >= from`. The shared client helper merges both pages by interaction id before recurrence expansion, keeps the regular window copy when a master appears in both responses, and orders recurring candidates first so a saturated regular window cannot discard every master from the combined 500-item budget.
- **Toolbar search is client-side** over the loaded window: interaction `title`/`body` are encrypted at rest (tenant encryption defaults ON), so the route's server-side `?search=` ILIKE cannot match them (documented in the route); list payloads arrive decrypted, making client filtering both correct and cheap.
- Relevant response fields consumed: listed in Data Models (already returned today, incl. `updatedAt` for locking).
### Create / edit
- `POST | PUT /api/customers/interactions` from `CalendarEventEditor` via `useGuardedMutation` (`retryLastMutation` in injection context); create requires `entityId` + `interactionType` (existing validator) → the editor's "Related to" picker supplies `entityId` (+ optional `dealId`).
- Optimistic locking: PUT carries `buildOptimisticLockHeader(item.updatedAt)`; 409 surfaced via `surfaceRecordConflict(err, t)`.
### Conflict check (editor)
- `CalendarEventEditor` uses the same `fetchCalendarCandidates` range read and recurrence expansion as the grid, then applies `findEditorConflictItems` for its candidate-vs-existing warning. The older `/api/customers/interactions/conflicts` endpoint remains unchanged for `ScheduleActivityDialog`.
### Supporting reads
- Activity-type dictionary: same endpoint/hook the detail pages use for `activity-types` (labels + colors for tabs/pills/legend).
- Participant/owner names for avatars: `participants[].name` (stored) with `/api/staff/team-members/assignable` (existing `fetchAssignableStaffMembers`) only inside the dialog's participant picker — the grid renders avatars from stored participant names (no N+1 lookups).

## Internationalization (i18n)
All new strings under `customers.calendar.*` in `packages/core/src/modules/customers/i18n/{en,de,es,pl}.json`. Key groups: `nav` (sidebar/breadcrumb), `header` (title formats, subtitle counts — ICU-style plurals via existing t() params), `toolbar` (today, presets, search placeholder, filter), `tabs`, `views` (day/week/month/agenda), `grid` (allDay lane, more count), `cards` (join, seeConflict, cancelled, conflictedCount, daysLater), `agenda` (today/tomorrow markers, eventsCount), `dialog` (field labels, validation), `shortcuts` (legend + help dialog), `footer.timezone`, `empty` states, `errors`. No hardcoded user-facing strings; internal throws prefixed `[internal]`.

## UI/UX
**Source of truth:** Figma `oTF1oZoaNgFUdtmxEX2oSc` page *Calendar*; frames: Week `1759:6779`, Day `1761:7917`, Month `1761:8607`, Agenda `1761:9420` (each: `Sidebar` 280px — existing app shell, out of scope — and `main` 1160px: `1759:6837`, `1761:7975`, `1761:8665`, `1761:9478`). Implementers MUST pull `get_design_context` for the `main` frames and match spacing/typography/radii exactly. Mockup variables map onto the app DS: Inter; `Label/Small` 14/20 −0.006em; `Paragraph/X Small` 12/16; `Subheading/2X Small` 11/12 ls-2 uppercase (grid column headers); borders `#e5e5e5`/soft `#ebebeb` → `border-border`/`border-soft`-equivalent tokens; text `#171717`/`#5c5c5c`/`#a3a3a3`/`#737373` → foreground/sub/soft/muted tokens; state colors success `#16a34a`+`#f0fdf4`, warning `#d97706`+`#fffbeb`, error `#dc2626`+`#fef2f2` → `{property}-status-{status}-{role}` tokens; radii 4/6/8/10/12/full → DS scale. Event tints (e.g. `blue/200 #c7d2fe`, `yellow/200 #ffecc0`) are **data-driven** type colors (dictionary `appearanceColor`) applied via inline style with soft-tint derivation, exactly like existing activity timeline appearance colors — never hardcoded Tailwind color classes.

### Common chrome (all four views)
- **Header** (per the 2026-06-12 Figma revision, which REMOVED the icon square and subtitle): title only — Day & Week → `MMM dd, yyyy`; Month → `MMMM yyyy`; Agenda → "Upcoming". Right: primary CTA **"+ New event"** (dark primary button, radius-10).
- **Toolbar**: `Today` button · range preset select (This week / Next 7 days / This month / Next 30 days — sets view+anchor) · range chip with calendar icon showing the computed visible range, click opens DatePicker to jump anchor · right side: search input (kbd hint `/`; filters the loaded window client-side — see API Contracts) · `Filter` button opening a popover (type multi-select, status, owner) with active-count badge.
- **Upcoming cards**: next 4 upcoming non-cancelled… **correction**: next 4 upcoming items by effective start ≥ now (cancelled ones included to surface the Cancelled state, matching mockup); card = title, time range, chevron menu (Open, Edit, Cancel), status strip: *today* → green `Today` + `Join Meeting` link when `location` is a URL/platform; *conflicted* → warning `{n} Conflicted` + `See Conflict` (navigates to that time in week view and pulses the involved blocks); *cancelled* → error `Cancelled` + date; *future* → neutral relative time (`3 days later`) + date.
- **Tabs**: `All Scheduled` (grid icon) / `Meetings (n)` / `Events (n)` — counts from the loaded window after search/filter; underline-style active state per mockup. Right-aligned view switcher: segmented `Day | Week | Month | Agenda`.
- **Footer bar**: kbd legend `T Today · D Day view · W Week · M Month · A Agenda · N New event · / Search · ? Shortcuts` + right-aligned resolved timezone "Europe/Warsaw (GMT+2)" (from `Intl.DateTimeFormat` resolved options; display-only).
- **States**: loading via `LoadingMessage`/skeleton rows; error via `ErrorMessage`; empty ranges get per-view `EmptyState` (e.g. "Nothing scheduled this week") with a New event action.

### Week & Day views (TimeGrid)
- Sticky day-header row: `dd EEE` uppercase (`04 MON`) `Subheading/2X Small`; prev/next chevron pair at the gutter corner; Day view header `EEEE — dd`.
- Time gutter labels `9 AM` … (Paragraph/X Small, soft); hour rows ≈ 84px per Figma; half-hour hairlines soft.
- Event block: radius-6, 1px gap stacking, soft type-tinted background, title `Label/X Small` strong, time `Paragraph/X Small` sub; optional bottom meta row: `AvatarStack` (xs, max 3 + `+N`) and right-aligned platform chip (`on Zoom` / `on Meet` / `on Slack` derived from `location` matching known platforms; 🌐-style icon + truncated link for URLs; pin icon + `Venue: …` for physical locations). Past/done items render muted (faded background, sub text); `canceled` items render struck-through title + faded.
- Overlapping items column-pack side-by-side (equal widths within the overlap cluster).
- All-day lane between header and grid when all-day items exist in range.
- **Non-working days** (Sat/Sun): column background uses the Figma diagonal hatch treatment (taken from frame `1759:6779`'s hatched column).
- Week starts Monday; 7 columns (see adaptations).

### Month view (MonthGrid)
- 7-column MON–SUN header (`Subheading/2X Small` uppercase); 5–6 week rows ≈ 86px height; out-of-month day numbers soft; today = filled dark circle badge on the day number.
- Items as single-line pills: tinted background (type color), centered dot + UPPERCASE truncated title `Label/X Small`; max 2 pills per cell then `+N more` (soft text button → switches to Day view on that date).
- Cell click on empty space → Day view for that date; pill click → edit dialog.

### Agenda view (AgendaList)
- Sticky-ish day group headers: `EEEE, MMM d` strong + `· Today/Tomorrow` marker + `{n} events` right-soft, on `bg-weak` band.
- Rows: time column (start strong, end below soft) · 3px rounded type-color bar · title `Label/Small` strong with subtitle `Type · Location` soft · right: `AvatarStack` (xs) + category badge (`MEETING` info-tint / `EVENT` warning-tint / `TASK` neutral-dark) uppercase `Label/X Small`.
- Horizon: anchor + `agendaHorizon` (default 7 days, presets can extend); groups only for days with items; row click → edit dialog.

### Create/Edit — CalendarEventEditor (designer-specified, Figma `1771:11122/11220/11309/11384/11423/11521`)
One 440px modal (`rounded-[16px]`, heavy drop shadow, Modal Header "New event" + close, Body `px-[24px] py-[22px] gap-[18px]`, Modal Footer Cancel/"Save event") with a joined **type switcher** (Meeting | Call | Email | Note | Event | Task; active segment `bg-weak` + strong text) morphing the field set:
| Field | Meeting | Call | Email | Note | Event | Task |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Title label | Title | Title | Subject | Note | Title | Title |
| Related to (person/company chip + optional deal badge chip) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| All day toggle | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| Date/time | Starts + Ends (date select + 120px time input each) | When (single) | Sent (single) | Logged (single) | Starts + Ends | Due (single) |
| Repeat (freq select + 36px M–S day pills + Ends: Never/On date/After) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ |
| Category (select rendering the activity-types dictionary entry as an uppercase tinted pill) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Location/contact | Location (map-pin, URL/venue) | Phone / link | — | — | Location | — |
| People | Attendees (multi chips: staff + customer w/ CUSTOMER badge) | Participants (same) | To (recipients) | — | Attendees | Assignee (single staff) |
| Priority (Low/Med/High button group) | — | — | — | — | — | ✓ |
| Description textarea | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
> **Revised 2026-07-02 (issue #3552)**: the editor is now an embedded `CrudForm` (custom fields + fieldsets via `entityIds=[E.customers.customer_interaction]`, injection spots, built-in Cmd+Enter and optimistic locking); the type switcher is dictionary-driven (all active `activity-types` entries, per-type morphology via `editorKindOfInteractionType` with a `meeting`-shaped default for custom types); a Resources multi-select (stored in `linkedEntities` as `type: 'resources:resource'`) renders when the resources module is loaded; staff lookups are gated on the staff module. See the 2026-07-02 changelog entry.

Behavior: Cmd/Ctrl+Enter submit, Escape cancel; create defaults to the calendar's anchor date; edit mode opens with the item's type tab active and fields prefilled; save-time server conflict warning (existing endpoint) shown non-blocking; success → flash + window refetch. Deletion is not in the editor (not mocked); cards' Cancel action sets `status: canceled` via the same guarded PUT. Field-mapping per the Design Decisions table; `status` is always `planned` on create.

### Keyboard shortcuts
Page-scoped `keydown` listener (ignores events from inputs/dialogs): `t` today, `d/w/m/a` views, `n` new event, `/` focus search, `?` opens a small shortcuts dialog mirroring the legend. Listener detaches on unmount; no global registry changes.

### Settings / Customization modal (Figma `1788:3701`, added 2026-06-13)
The toolbar gear (previously omitted — see adaptations) now opens a **Customization** modal (`rounded-2xl`, header "Customization" + "Customise your calendar module." + close, body, footer Cancel / **Save Changes**). It is a per-user **view-preference** panel, persisted to **localStorage** scoped by user id (mirrors the approved `deals/pipeline` lane-width pattern) — **no new entity, API, or migration**, consistent with the spec's premise. Contents:
- **Event Categories** (max 8) — `TagInput`; user-defined grouping labels offered as quick category options in the editor. Starts empty (the Figma example chips are illustrative).
- **Activity Types** (max 6) — `TagInput`; **seeded from the tenant `activity-types` dictionary** on first open, used as the editor's category quick-pick set. Editing it personalizes the per-user pick list only — it **never mutates the shared tenant dictionary** (which keeps its own admin surface) and never hides existing events.
- Four `Switch` toggles wired to real behavior: **Show CRM activities on calendar** (default on; off → only `meeting`/`event` categories render), **AI summaries & quick actions** (default on; gates the peek popover's meta-summary line + Join quick action), **Conflict warnings** (default on; gates conflict rings, the inline "N conflicts" badge, and the conflicted upcoming-card variant), **Show weekends** (default **off** → week renders Mon–Fri; on → Mon–Sun with the existing non-working hatch).

### Week-view states (Figma `1786:2934`, added 2026-06-13)
- **Empty**: per-view `EmptyState` gains a description ("Plan a meeting, event or task to fill your week.") and a **New event** action (gated by `customers.interactions.manage`).
- **Loading**: initial load keeps `LoadingMessage` (skeleton-grid is a documented future refinement; non-blocking).
- **Hover · selected**: clicking a time-grid block selects it (2px `ring-foreground` + shadow) and opens an `EventPeekPopover` (title, `EEE, MMM d · h:mm` range, optional meta "platform · N attendees", **Join** when joinable, **Edit**). Edit opens the full editor; the peek replaces the previous click-opens-editor-directly behavior on the time grid (month/agenda still open the editor directly).
- **Conflict**: each time-grid column with conflicting blocks shows an inline error-tint **"N conflicts"** badge (in addition to the per-block ring), gated by the Conflict warnings toggle.
- **Drag to create**: pointer-drag on empty grid space draws a dashed preview block and, on release, opens the create editor with the dragged date + start/end prefilled (snapped to 15-minute steps, min 30 minutes). Drag-to-**create** only — drag-to-reschedule remains out of scope. Gated by `customers.interactions.manage`.

### Documented mockup adaptations (deliberate, business-logic-driven)
| Mockup artifact | Decision |
|---|---|
| Header CTAs `Schedule` + `Create Request` | Design-template carryover; replaced by a single primary **"+ New event"** (the mockup's own footer legend defines `N New event`). Visual style of the primary button preserved. |
| Sidebar group `GENERAL` with a `Dashboard` item above Calendar | The app shell has no "General" sidebar group and no Dashboard sidebar item (logo navigates to `/backend`); group order is hardcoded in shared auth chrome. Calendar registers as the **first item of the Customers group** instead — no shared-chrome modification. |
| Toolbar preset `Last 7 days` (backward) | Forward-looking calendar presets (This week / Next 7 days / This month / Next 30 days). Same select styling. |
| Week view shows 5 columns (04 MON–08 FRI, FRI hatched) with header range `Feb 04 – Feb 11` | Inconsistent demo data (Feb 04 2024 was a Sunday). Implemented as a Monday-start **7-day week**; the hatch treatment is applied to non-working days (Sat/Sun). Keeps every event visible; preserves the hatch visual language. |
| Toolbar gear icon | Now wired to the **Customization** modal added in the 2026-06-13 Figma revision (`1788:3701`) — see the Settings / Customization subsection. (Was omitted in v1 when the gear had no defined behavior.) |
| Settings persistence not specified in the mockup | View preferences (toggles + the two tag lists) persist to per-user **localStorage**, not a new server entity/API — keeps the spec's "no new entity/API/migration" premise. Tag lists personalize the editor's category pick list only and never mutate the tenant dictionary. Documented for review; a server-backed/tenant-wide settings store is clean future work. |
| "AI summaries & quick actions" toggle has no dedicated mocked affordance | Wired to the peek popover's meta-summary line + Join quick action (default on). LLM-generated summaries are future work behind the same flag — no new dependency added. |
| Topbar/sidebar (Acme tenant, AI chips, Reservations NEW…) | Existing app shell; not part of this feature. |
| Search kbd hint `⌘1` | Uses `/` per the mockup's own footer legend. |

## Frontend Architecture Contract
### Server/Client Boundary Map
| Route / surface | Server root | Client islands | Data owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/backend/calendar` | `backend/calendar/page.tsx` (server: metadata, `resolveTranslations`, shell) | `CalendarScreen` (orchestrator), lazy `InteractionDialog` | existing interactions API via `apiCall` | No page-root `"use client"`; view leaves are plain client children of `CalendarScreen` |

### "use client" Ledger
| File | Reason | Imported by | Heavy deps? | Cleanup / hydration risk | Alternative rejected |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `components/calendar/CalendarScreen.tsx` | stateful view/anchor/tab state, data fetching, keydown listener | server page | none (date-fns only, already in tree) | keydown listener removed on unmount | RSC — calendar is inherently interactive |
| `components/calendar/CalendarEventEditor.tsx` (lazy-mounted) | typed create/edit modal (form state, guarded mutations) | CalendarScreen (`next/dynamic`) | none new | none | extending `ScheduleActivityDialog` — would mutate a maintained detail-page component into a different design |
View leaves (`TimeGrid`, `MonthGrid`, `AgendaList`, `UpcomingCards`, `CalendarToolbar`, …) are client components by inheritance (no own `"use client"` directive needed) — each ≤ ~250 LOC.

### Client Blob Guardrail & Budgets
| Budget | Default target | Spec value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generated backend page-root `"use client"` | 0 new unallowlisted | 0 |
| Touched client page/root files over 300 LOC | 0 unless justified | 0 (CalendarScreen split into leaves; each ≤ ~250 LOC) |
| Heavy browser libraries at page/provider root | 0 | 0 (**no** react-big-calendar, no new deps) |
| Per-route hydration smoke test | required | Playwright TC-CAL-002 loads `/backend/calendar`, asserts grid + interacts |
| Performance evidence | static + one runtime signal | `yarn check:client-boundaries` + `yarn build:app` route size note in PR |

### Provider / Bootstrap Scope
None touched. No global providers, no bootstrap registry changes.

## Configuration
None. No env vars, no settings.

## Migration & Compatibility
- **DB**: none.
- **Seeds**: additive `event` entry in `activity-types` dictionary defaults (skipped when present).
- **BC surfaces** (per `BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md` categories): no type/signature/import-path/event-id/spot-id/DB/DI/CLI changes. Additive only: new backend page route `/backend/calendar` (new surface), new i18n keys, new module-internal components, and the optional `recurrenceMasters` query field on the existing interactions list API. Omitting the field preserves the previous SQL filters and response shape byte-for-byte. Existing `MiniWeekCalendar`/detail pages remain untouched.
- **RBAC**: page gated by existing `customers.interactions.view`; dialog mutations already gated by `customers.interactions.manage` server-side (CTA hidden without it via existing feature-check helpers).

## Implementation Plan
Reference implementations: page+meta `backend/customer-tasks/page.{tsx,meta.ts}`; screen composition `backend/customers/deals/page.tsx`; data calls `apiCall`; appearance colors: activity timeline components.

### Phase 1 — Scaffold & data plumbing
1. `backend/calendar/page.meta.ts` (requireAuth, `customers.interactions.view`, `pageGroup: 'Customers'` + existing `customers.nav.group` key, lowest `pageOrder` in the group, calendar icon, breadcrumb) + server `page.tsx`.
2. `lib/calendar/` pure utils: `range.ts` (view→range math, Monday weeks, padding), `categories.ts` (mapping + counts), `conflicts.ts`, `recurrence.ts` (window expansion; **local minimal RRULE subset matching what the platform's only producer — `ScheduleActivityDialog.buildRecurrenceRule` — emits: `FREQ=DAILY|WEEKLY` + `BYDAY` + `COUNT`/`UNTIL`**; `expandRecurringItems` from packages/ui ignores `BYDAY` and targets a different item shape, so it is not reused) — **with unit tests** (`__tests__/`).
3. `useCalendarItems` hook (range fetch + cursor follow + cap + refetch).
4. `CalendarScreen` shell: header, toolbar (Today/presets/range chip), tabs, view switcher, footer; views stubbed; i18n keys (all 4 locales); `yarn generate`.
   *Exit: page renders with chrome + empty states; unit tests green.*

### Phase 2 — TimeGrid (Week + Day)
5. `TimeGrid` (days=7|1): sticky headers, gutter, hour grid, all-day lane, hatched non-working columns, overlap packing, `EventBlock` (tints, avatars `AvatarStack`, platform/venue/link chips, muted past/done, struck cancelled), block click → dialog (Phase 5 wires create; until then no-op view).
   *Exit: week/day pixel-pass vs Figma `1759:6837`/`1761:7975`.*

### Phase 3 — MonthGrid + AgendaList
6. Month cells, pills, `+N more` → day-view jump, today badge.
7. Agenda day groups + rows per mockup.
   *Exit: month/agenda pixel-pass vs `1761:8665`/`1761:9478`.*

### Phase 4 — Upcoming cards, conflicts, search & filter
8. `UpcomingCards` with 4 status variants; conflict detection wiring (`See Conflict` navigates + pulses); search (server `search` within window, debounced) + filter popover (type/status/owner); tab counts react to filters.
   *Exit: conflicts visible for overlapping fixtures; cards match mockup.*

### Phase 5 — CalendarEventEditor + shortcuts + footer polish
9. Build `CalendarEventEditor` per the six Figma editor frames (type switcher, per-type fields, Related-to person/company+deal picker, staff+customer attendees, recurrence builder, category pill select, task priority/assignee); submits via `useGuardedMutation` (+ lock header on PUT, conflicts endpoint warning); lazy-mount from `CalendarScreen` for create (header CTA / `N`) and edit (block/row/card click).
10. Keyboard shortcuts + `?` help dialog; timezone footer.
    *Exit: full create→render→edit loop works.*

### Phase 6 — Integration tests, DS pass, docs
11. Implement Integration Test Coverage below; `om-ds-guardian` pass on touched UI; spec changelog + Implementation Status update.

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit** (jest, module-local): range math (Monday weeks, month grids incl. DST boundaries), category mapping (custom types → other), conflict pairs (owner overlap, participant overlap, cancelled excluded, touching-not-overlapping), recurrence windowing, platform-chip derivation from `location`.
- **Integration** (Playwright): see below.
- **Manual/preview**: pixel pass against the four Figma frames at 1440px.

## Integration Test Coverage (required)
Self-contained Playwright specs in `packages/core/src/modules/customers/__integration__/` (API fixtures created in setup, cleaned in teardown; no seeded-data reliance):
- **TC-CAL-001 — API range read**: create person + three interactions via API (planned meeting tomorrow 10:00–11:00, done call yesterday, planned task next week); `GET /api/customers/interactions?from&to` window returns exactly the in-range items with `scheduledAt/durationMinutes/participants/updatedAt`; 401 unauthenticated; 403 for a user without `customers.interactions.view`.
- **TC-CAL-002 — page load & week grid (hydration smoke)**: `/backend/calendar` renders header, tabs, switcher, footer; fixture meeting visible as a week-grid block with title + time; sidebar shows Calendar in the Customers group.
- **TC-CAL-003 — view switching & navigation**: switcher and `D/W/M/A` keys swap views (day column header, month pill, agenda row all show the fixture); `T` returns to today; prev/next chevrons shift the visible range label.
- **TC-CAL-004 — tabs & filtering**: fixtures of types meeting + event + task; Meetings/Events tab counts correct; activating Meetings hides the event pill; search narrows to a fixture by title.
- **TC-CAL-005 — create via editor**: `N` opens the editor; switch type tab (field set morphs — e.g. Task shows Due + the Priority dropdown defaulting to Medium + Assignee); fill title/Related-to person/date/time; save; flash shown; new block appears in the grid without reload; teardown deletes it.
- **TC-CAL-006 — conflict surfacing**: two overlapping planned meetings sharing owner → upcoming card shows `Conflicted` badge and `See Conflict` navigates to the overlap time.
- **TC-CAL-012 — recurring master outside visible window**: create a weekly interaction whose master is in the previous week, open the calendar on the following week, and assert its expanded occurrence is rendered once. The ordinary range response excludes the master while `recurrenceMasters=true` returns it, pinning both API selection and UI deduplication/expansion.
- **TC-CAL-007 — settings/customization modal** (Figma `1788:3701`): the toolbar gear opens the Customization modal (Event Categories + Activity Types tag inputs seeded from the activity-types dictionary, four toggles); toggling **Show weekends** ON + Save makes the week render 7 day-columns (Sat/Sun appear); the preference survives a page reload (localStorage, per-user scope); Cancel discards an unsaved toggle change.
- **TC-CAL-008 — week-view states** (Figma `1786:2934`): clicking a time-grid event block opens the peek popover (title, date · time, **Edit**; **Join** only when the location is a URL and AI summaries are on) and marks the block selected; **Edit** opens the editor in edit mode; a drag on empty grid space opens the create editor with the dragged start/end prefilled; with two overlapping planned meetings the column shows the inline **"N conflicts"** badge, which disappears when **Conflict warnings** is toggled off.
- **TC-CAL-009 — editor conflict detection**: two overlapping planned meetings sharing an owner; opening the editor on one surfaces the **"Overlaps with: …"** warning naming the other — verifying the editor's conflict warning uses the same `findConflicts` rules as the grid badges/rings.
- **TC-CAL-011 — resource links (#3552)**: `POST /api/customers/interactions` with `linkedEntities` mixing a `resource`-typed link (FK-id + label snapshot) and a `deal` link is accepted (201) and both round-trip through the windowed list read with id/type/label intact; an unknown link type is rejected with 400 — pinning `interactionLinkedEntitySchema`'s `['company','deal','offer','resource']` enum so the resource-assignment contract cannot silently narrow.

## Risks & Impact Review
### Data Integrity Failures
- Read-only views cannot corrupt data. Writes go through the existing command-backed API (transactional, undo-integrated). Dialog edit conflicts are covered by the default optimistic-lock header + conflict bar.

### Cascading Failures & Side Effects
- No new events/subscribers. A failing dictionary fetch degrades to neutral colors (UI fallback, non-blocking).

### Tenant & Data Isolation Risks
- All reads/writes ride the existing interactions route, which already enforces tenant/org scope + email-visibility filtering server-side. The page adds no query surface of its own.

### Migration & Deployment Risks
- No migrations. Seed change is insert-if-absent. Rollback = remove page files.

### Operational Risks
- Blast radius: the new route only. No shared component is modified.

### Risk Register
#### Large ranges exceed the fetch cap
- **Scenario**: A month window holds > 500 interactions; cursor-following stops at the cap and some items are not rendered.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Affected area**: Month view completeness for very active tenants.
- **Mitigation**: Hard cap with an explicit on-page notice ("Showing first 500…"), counts labelled accordingly; recurring candidates are placed before regular-only payloads in the combined cap while duplicate ids still keep the regular-window representation, so a saturated regular page cannot erase the overlay entirely. Week/day windows are normally far below the cap.
- **Residual risk**: Month pill counts may undercount for extreme tenants — acceptable for v1; server aggregation endpoint listed as future work.
#### Recurrence expansion mismatch
- **Scenario**: Client RRULE expansion disagrees with future server-side expectations (e.g. complex BYDAY rules unsupported).
- **Severity**: Low
- **Mitigation**: Expansion limited to display; unsupported rules render the base occurrence only, and filter dropdowns derive dynamic types/owners from range-filtered visible items so an out-of-window fallback master cannot leak metadata into the toolbar. Unit tests pin the supported subset (DAILY/WEEKLY + interval + until/count).
- **Residual risk**: Exotic rules show fewer occurrences — acceptable, matches current platform behavior (nothing expands them today).
#### Recurring-master overlay query
- **Scenario**: A recurring master predates the visible range, so a plain `from`/`to` read cannot provide the row needed for client-side expansion.
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: `fetchCalendarCandidates` performs two parallel, opt-in cursor-followed reads for both the grid and editor conflict probe, using the same effective-date anchor, deduplicating by id, and applying the combined 500-item cap and truncation notice. The two-call shape is deliberately retained instead of adding an `OR` mode to the established list contract: it keeps default consumers byte-for-byte unchanged and makes each branch independently testable.
- **Accepted scale/cost**: The recurrence overlay is a partial scan under existing tenant/organization/deleted scoping because no recurrence-specific index is added in this no-schema-change PR. The operational assumption is fewer than 500 recurrence-bearing masters per organization; each branch remains capped at five 100-row pages and the client expands only inside the padded visible window. A logical lookback bound cannot be added without hiding valid never-ending series whose master is old.
- **Residual risk**: Rules bounded only by `COUNT` or an RRULE `UNTIL` may be fetched after their final occurrence because SQL intentionally avoids parsing RRULE text. If recurrence-bearing rows approach the 500-row assumption or route latency regresses, add a partial expression index on tenant, organization, and the effective-date coalesce in a schema-focused follow-up; until then the extra read and possible stale master expansion are accepted and observable through the truncation notice.
#### Mockup-data ambiguities mis-resolved
- **Scenario**: An adaptation (7-day week, CTA naming, presets) contradicts the designer's intent.
- **Severity**: Low
- **Mitigation**: Every adaptation is documented in UI/UX with rationale; all are presentation-level and reversible in minutes.
- **Residual risk**: Possible follow-up tweak PR — acceptable.
#### Timezone display vs stored timestamps
- **Scenario**: Users in different timezones see shifted blocks and blame data.
- **Severity**: Low
- **Mitigation**: All rendering uses the browser timezone and says so in the footer (mockup behavior). Storage stays UTC.
- **Residual risk**: No per-user tz preference exists platform-wide — out of scope here.

## Changelog
### 2026-08-07 — Issue #4735: recurring masters outside the visible window
- Added the backward-compatible `recurrenceMasters=true` interactions-list filter and a parallel calendar fetch for recurring series that can overlap the visible range.
- Regular and recurring results are deduplicated before client-side expansion, preserving the existing 500-item safety cap. Recurring candidates receive cap priority while duplicate ids retain the regular-window payload.
- Review follow-up aligned the overlay upper bound with `coalesce(occurred_at, scheduled_at, created_at)`, shared the two-query candidate fetch with the editor conflict probe, limited dynamic filter options to visible items, and documented the accepted unindexed/two-request cost and expected recurrence scale. Unit coverage pins the SQL bounds, hook/probe fetch path, saturated merge policy, and duplicate handling; TC-CAL-012 covers the end-to-end calendar behavior.

### 2026-07-02 — Issue #3552: dictionary-driven types, CrudForm editor, resources & staff gating
- **Dictionary-driven type switcher** (bug: fixed six-type list): the editor's type switcher now renders the tenant's `activity-types` dictionary entries (seeded + tenant-added, active only) instead of the hardcoded `EDITOR_KINDS`. Field morphology per type resolves through `editorKindOfInteractionType` (known keys keep their per-kind config; custom types get the `meeting`-shaped default: Starts+Ends, all-day, repeat, location, attendees). Selecting a switcher entry sets both the morphology kind and the saved `interactionType`. The Category select stays (full dictionary + the user's custom quick-pick labels from Customization settings).
- **Editor migrated to `CrudForm`** (embedded inside the existing Dialog shell, pattern: `ActivityForm`): custom-component fields wrap the existing editor subcomponents; `entityIds=[E.customers.customer_interaction]` enables custom fields **and fieldsets**; the standard injection spots (`crud-form:customers:customer_interaction` + `:fields`) become available to other modules (e.g. future product assignment per #3554); `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter` submit and optimistic locking (auto-derived from `initialValues.updatedAt`) come from `CrudForm` built-ins. The save-time conflict warning Alert is preserved via `contentHeader`.
- **Resource assignment (no migration)**: events can link multiple resources via the existing `CustomerInteraction.linkedEntities` JSONB (`{ id, type: 'resources:resource', label }` — FK-id + label snapshot per the sanctioned cross-module data pattern). New editor multi-select searches `GET /api/resources/resources`; non-resource `linkedEntities` entries are preserved on edit. The field renders only when the `resources` module is loaded (server flag from `getModules()` passed down from `backend/calendar/page.tsx`).
- **Staff gating**: staff lookups (attendees / participants / task assignee) run only when the `staff` module is loaded; `searchPeopleOptions` degrades to customer-only options and the task Assignee field hides when staff is absent. Staff fetch failures no longer reject the whole people search.
- **Dark-mode category contrast fix**: `categoryPillStyle` mixed pill text toward literal `black` (and fallback background toward `white`), which is unreadable in dark mode; it now mixes toward `var(--foreground)` / `var(--background)` so tints adapt to the active theme.
- **Wider two-column editor on desktop** (owner request, supersedes the mockup's 440px single column): the dialog grows to `max-w-lg` (sm) / `max-w-3xl` (lg) and on `lg+` the fields group into two thematic columns — WHEN (all-day, start/end, repeat) on the left, CONTEXT (related record, category, location) on the right — with the type switcher, Title and Description spanning both and People/Resources (+ task Priority/Assignee) pairing below. Phones keep the full-screen single-column sheet.
- **Type-switcher icons**: switcher entries render the dictionary entry's appearance icon (`renderDictionaryIcon`; lucide + emoji) with the seeded kind icons as fallback (`EDITOR_KIND_ICONS`), so tenant-added types keep their configured icon in the editor.
- **Owner UI feedback round (2026-07-02)**: the time-grid empty-state overlay card ("Nothing scheduled…") is removed entirely (month/agenda empty states unchanged); the Category picker drops the uppercase tinted pills for a color dot + plain label row (`categoryPillStyle` deleted); the editor dialog no longer stretches edge-to-edge (`sm:max-h-[calc(100dvh-4rem)]`) and the field spacing is compacted (gap-4, shorter description, `min-h-14` people boxes).
- **Owner UI feedback round 2 (2026-07-02)**: the separate Category field is REMOVED from the editor — the dictionary-driven type switcher is the single type control (`buildEditorCategoryOptions`, `CategoryField` and the editor's use of the Customization tag lists deleted; the Customization modal's Event Categories / Activity Types inputs are now display-only pending a follow-up decision). The custom-fields "Manage fields" gear in the event dialog opens the FULL field-definitions page in a new tab instead of the nested quick-editor (new opt-in `CrudForm.customFieldsManageMode='page'`; all other forms keep the inline dialog). Task Priority renders as a full-width, equal-segment control with ArrowDown/Minus/ArrowUp icons (`SegmentGroup fullWidth`). `FieldDefinitionsEditor` strings are fully i18n-ised (en/pl/es/de) so the quick-editor no longer mixes languages.

### 2026-06-11
- Initial specification (Figma `oTF1oZoaNgFUdtmxEX2oSc` page `1759:723`; mockup adaptations documented; no schema/API changes).
- Pre-implement audit corrections applied (`.ai/specs/analysis/ANALYSIS-2026-06-11-crm-calendar.md`): sidebar group Customers (no "General" group exists), client-side search (encrypted title/body), local RRULE subset incl. `BYDAY` (producer: `ScheduleActivityDialog.buildRecurrenceRule`), reuse + extend `ScheduleActivityDialog` (existing `/api/customers/interactions/conflicts` check), seed lives in `cli.ts` `ACTIVITY_TYPE_DEFAULTS`.

### 2026-06-12
- Figma revision absorbed (designer added modals + adjustments): six "Event editor" frames (`1771:11122/11220/11309/11384/11423/11521`) specify a unified typed create/edit modal → new `CalendarEventEditor` component (per-type field morphology, Related-to person/company+deal, staff+customer attendees, task priority/assignee); the planned `ScheduleActivityDialog` extension was superseded and reverted (component ships untouched). Page header simplified in all four views (icon square + subtitle line removed).
- Implemented through review fixes. Visual-verification fixes: stronger weekend hatch, "This week" initial preset, singular "1 day later"/"1 event", agenda platform display names (Google Meet/Zoom/…), visible-range re-filter so fetch padding never leaks into counts/cards, month grid stretches to fill the view area. Review fixes: conflicts computed over the pre-tab filtered window; "New event"/edit affordances hidden without `customers.interactions.manage` (feature-check + shared wildcard matcher); undated interactions documented as excluded from all views.
- Cross-model review fixes (Codex 5.5 xhigh, both confirmed real): editor conflict probe now unwraps the conflicts endpoint's `{ok, result}` envelope (warning never displayed before; note — `ScheduleActivityDialog` carries the same pre-existing dormant bug, flagged for a separate fix); recurrence expansion treats `recurrenceEnd` (stored as UTC midnight of the until-date) as inclusive end-of-day so the final occurrence is no longer dropped (regression test added). Client search additionally matches the description body.
- Responsive overhaul (Google/Outlook mobile patterns; verified at 390/1440 px against a ~280-event dataset): phones default to Day view; toolbar stacks (Today + range row, full-width search + icon filter; preset hidden); upcoming cards become a snap carousel; week grid scrolls horizontally with sticky time gutter/header corner (rows span content width — sticky-in-flex parent-clamp fix) and 120px column floors; month cells render color dots + "+N" with single-letter weekday header; agenda hides avatars and tightens columns; editor opens as a full-screen sheet; shortcuts footer hidden on touch. Participant avatars de-overlapped everywhere (agenda: max 2 separated circles + "+N" text; data-level de-dupe of duplicate participant userIds fixing React key collisions). Manual QA (Opus agent, 19-area pass over all flows incl. all six editor types end-to-end): two findings fixed — weekly-recurrence day pills now follow the start date instead of today (BYDAY correctness, unit-tested) and the mobile sticky gutter; everything else passed with zero functional console errors.

- Absorbed the designer's later Figma additions — two new frames: **Calendar settings / Customization modal** (`1788:3701`) and **Calendar / Week view — states** (`1786:2934`).
- **Customization modal** (`CalendarSettingsModal` + `useCalendarPreferences`): per-user view preferences persisted to localStorage (no new entity/API/migration). Event Categories (max 8) + Activity Types (max 6, seeded from the `activity-types` dictionary, non-destructive) tag inputs, and four wired toggles — Show CRM activities (category filter), AI summaries & quick actions (peek meta-summary + Join), Conflict warnings (rings/badge/card gating), Show weekends (week Mon–Fri ↔ Mon–Sun, default off). Opened from a new toolbar gear (previously omitted).
- **Week-view states**: `EventPeekPopover` on time-grid block select (title, date·time, meta, Join/Edit) with a 2px selected ring; inline per-column "N conflicts" badge; pointer **drag-to-create** (15-min snap, ≥30-min, opens the editor with the range prefilled via a new `createDefaultFormState` range arg + editor `defaultRange` prop); enriched empty state (description + New event action).
- New pure helpers `lib/calendar/{preferences,grid}.ts` with unit tests (18 cases). New i18n keys `customers.calendar.{settings,peek}.*` + `grid.conflict(s)Count` + `empty.description` across en/de/es/pl. Integration coverage TC-CAL-007 (settings) and TC-CAL-008 (week-view states) added. Decisions (localStorage persistence, non-destructive tag lists, AI-toggle wiring) documented in Documented mockup adaptations; preview-verified at 1440px.
- Review-feedback fixes: (1) the Customization settings modal showed a **double close (X)** — it rendered its own header X on top of `DialogContent`'s auto X; added `dismissible={false}` (matching `CalendarEventEditor`) so only the header X remains. (2) **Editor conflict detection was inconsistent with the grid** — the save-time probe used the `/interactions/conflicts` endpoint, which scopes overlaps to the *current user's* authored/owned events and ignores participants, so conflicts the grid shows (shared owner *or* participant) were often not surfaced in the editor. The editor now detects conflicts client-side with the **same `findConflicts` rules as the grid** (extracted into `findEditorConflictItems`, unit-tested) against a freshly-fetched ±1-day window, keyed on the edited event's owner (or the current user for new events) + its participants. The shared `/interactions/conflicts` endpoint is left untouched (still used by `ScheduleActivityDialog`). New unit suite `editorConflicts.test.ts` (owner/participant match, no-overlap, exclude-self, canceled) + integration test TC-CAL-009.
- Cross-model review (Codex 5.5 xhigh) fixes — three real defects the in-family review missed, all caught by Codex: (1) the Event Categories / Activity Types tag lists were decorative — now wired into the editor via `buildEditorCategoryOptions` (unit-tested): Activity Types filters the editor's category set (empty = show-all floor, so the picker is never unusable), Event Categories add custom quick-pick labels; (2) drag-to-create crashed because `moveDrag` read `event.currentTarget` inside a deferred `setState` updater — now read synchronously; (3) the time-grid event-block container occluded the drag-to-create layer (same z-level, painted on top) — container is now `pointer-events-none` with blocks `pointer-events-auto`, so empty-space drags reach the layer while blocks stay clickable. TC-CAL-008 gained a real-mouse drag test that exercises the full pointer→`onCreateRange`→editor `defaultRange` path (which exposed defects 2 and 3). The cross-model BC findings (new required props on `TimeGridProps`/`CalendarToolbarProps`) were not applicable — the calendar components are new in this same unmerged PR, so the prop interfaces have no released third-party consumers.
- Integration-suite reconciliation after the #3552 editor rework: the CrudForm migration turned Priority into a Jira-style dropdown (trigger button labelled "Priority", value shown inline) and the conflict-scope labels were shortened ("My meetings only"→"My meetings", "All org meetings"→"All meetings"), so TC-CAL-005 (Priority assertions) and TC-CAL-007 (conflict-scope button labels, incl. the persistence path) were updated to the new DOM contract. Added **TC-CAL-011** — an API-level guard that a `resource`-typed `linkedEntities` link is accepted and round-trips (mixed with a `deal` link) while an unknown link type is rejected with 400, pinning the `interactionLinkedEntitySchema` enum against silent narrowing. Full TC-CAL suite green (13 tests).
