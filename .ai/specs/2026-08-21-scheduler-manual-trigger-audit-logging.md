# Scheduler Manual Trigger Audit Logging

**Status:** Implemented — 2026-08-21 (awaiting deployment, so the spec stays in `.ai/specs/` and is
listed under Pending in the index)

## TLDR

`POST /api/scheduler/trigger` was the only scheduler mutation that never reached the
`CommandBus`, so manually running a schedule left no `ActionLog` row. This spec moves the trigger
behind a new `scheduler.jobs.trigger` command that records every authenticated attempt — success and
refusal alike — against the calling user, and makes a manually triggered command schedule execute as
the person who triggered it rather than as the schedule's creator.

Related: [`2026-07-28-audit-log-read-tenant-scope-fail-closed.md`](2026-07-28-audit-log-read-tenant-scope-fail-closed.md)
covers fail-closed audit-log **reads**; this spec covers a **write** path that was missing entirely.

## Problem Statement

1. **The trigger route was unaudited.** `scheduler.jobs.create`, `.update` and `.delete` all run
   through `commands/jobs.ts` with `scheduler.audit.*` labels. The trigger route talked to the ORM and
   the queue directly, and its only trace was a `logger.info` line.

   This matters more than an ordinary missing audit row. Manual triggering is an authorised-looking
   way to make an automated job execute at a moment of the actor's choosing, against a target the
   actor did not have to author.

2. **Refusals were invisible.** Probing schedule ids, or repeatedly trying to trigger a system-scoped
   schedule without super-admin, left nothing behind at all.

3. **Manual runs named the wrong person.** `buildScheduledCommandContext` only knew
   `schedule.createdByUserId`, so a manual run of a command schedule executed under the creator's
   identity. `ExecuteSchedulePayload.triggeredByUserId` was carried on the queue payload but never
   read by the worker.

4. **A gate/identity mismatch was latent in the same code.** `assertSchedulerSafeCommandAuthorized`
   RBAC-checks a user id taken straight off the schedule row and never sees the
   `CommandRuntimeContext`. Attributing the run to the triggerer without touching the gate would have
   authorized the creator while executing as somebody else.

## Proposed Solution

### `scheduler.jobs.trigger` command

New handler in `packages/scheduler/src/modules/scheduler/commands/trigger.ts`. It owns the whole
former route body: load the schedule by id, decide access via `resolveScheduleAccess`, check the
queue strategy, enqueue.

It returns a `TriggerScheduleResult` discriminated by `outcome`
(`enqueued | not_found | forbidden | strategy_unsupported | failed`) and **never throws for an
expected refusal**. The route maps `outcome` to HTTP.

### Route as a mapper

`api/trigger/route.ts` keeps the 401 short-circuit and the zod parse, builds a
`CommandRuntimeContext`, executes the command and maps the outcome. Response bodies and status codes
are unchanged.

### Actor attribution

`resolveScheduledCommandActorUserId(schedule, { triggeredByUserId })` in `lib/commandContext.ts` is
the single definition of the precedence *triggering user → creator → nobody*. The worker resolves the
actor once and passes it to both `assertSchedulerSafeCommandAuthorized` and
`buildScheduledCommandContext`, establishing the invariant: **the identity that executes is the
identity that was authorized.**

## Design Decisions

### Outcomes, not exceptions

`CommandBus.execute` (`packages/shared/src/lib/commands/command-bus.ts`) has no `try`/`catch`. A throw
from `handler.execute` propagates straight out, skipping `captureAfter`, `buildLog`, `persistLog`,
interceptors and cache invalidation. Nothing in the codebase ever writes `executionState: 'failed'`,
and the `ActionLog` entity has no error column.

Throwing on refusal would therefore lose exactly the entries this change exists to create. Returning
an outcome is a hard requirement, not a style preference.

### The log row carries the actor's scope, on every outcome

Unlike the sibling create/update/delete handlers, which log the schedule's tenant/organization,
`buildLog` here uses the caller's. A refusal must never carry the target's tenant: that would leak
cross-tenant existence into the caller's own trail, and because `ActionLogService` filters
`organization_id` with strict equality, it would file the row where the caller's auditors could never
read it.

### A refusal discloses nothing about the row

`resolveScheduleAccess` deliberately answers `not_found` rather than `403` for another tenant's
schedule so a caller cannot confirm an id exists. For `not_found` and `forbidden` the payload's
`scheduleName`, `targetType` and `target` stay `null`; details are populated only once access has been
granted. The requested id *is* recorded, so probing is traceable.

### A command schedule's authorization is decided at trigger time

The worker gates a command run with `assertSchedulerSafeCommandAuthorized`, and its only way to refuse
is to throw. Inside a retrying queue that refusal is invisible: the caller already has `200 ok`, the
audit row already says `enqueued`, and BullMQ retries a decision no attempt can turn into a success.

So `commands/trigger.ts` runs the same assertion, against the same actor the worker will resolve
(`resolveScheduledCommandActorUserId(schedule, { triggeredByUserId })`), before it enqueues anything.
A refusal becomes `outcome: 'forbidden'` — the caller's `403` and the audit row's outcome, decided
where the row is written. Unlike an access refusal it carries the schedule's details, because access
to the row has already been granted and naming it discloses nothing the decision withholds.

Only an authorization *decision* becomes `forbidden`, discriminated on
`SchedulerCommandAuthorizationError`. A `userHasAllFeatures` whose store is down, or an unresolvable
`rbacService`, is not a decision: answering `403` would tell the caller they lack access they may well
hold, and file an audit row claiming a refusal nobody made. Those return `failed`, the same outcome an
unreachable queue produces — still audited, since a handler that throws writes no row at all.

The worker keeps its gate: the pre-check can go stale between enqueue and execution, and unattended
runs never pass through the trigger command at all. What changed there is the shape of the refusal.
`assertSchedulerSafeCommandAuthorized` now raises `SchedulerCommandAuthorizationError` — every
rejection it makes is a permanent decision, not a transient failure — and the worker catches that one
type, emits `scheduler.job.failed` and returns, matching how the queue branch ends its equivalent
conditions. Any other error, such as an RBAC lookup whose store is down, still propagates so BullMQ
retries it.

### No undo

Registered `isUndoable: false` with no `undo`/`redo`. A queued execution runs as soon as a worker
picks it up, so an undo token would offer to reverse an enqueue that no longer exists while leaving
the run's real effects untouched; those are reversed through the entries the run itself writes. This
also keeps `TC-UNDO-001 §4` (trigger exposes no `x-om-operation` token) correct.

### Key-only callers keep acting as the creator

`triggeredByUserId` is populated from `resolveCommandActorUserId`, which reads `auth.userId` **before**
it considers `auth.isApiKey`. So an API key issued on a user's behalf resolves to that user and the run
is attributed to — and authorized as — them, which is the correct actor. Only a key-only context (no
bound user) yields `null`: a bare key id is not a user id, so an RBAC lookup against it could never
succeed, and falling back to the creator preserves today's behavior for that caller class.

### Command id

`scheduler.jobs.trigger` matches the `scheduler.jobs.<verb>` convention of the existing three command
ids. It is textually identical to the ACL feature id in `acl.ts`, which lives in a separate registry —
no functional collision, but grepping that string now returns both.

## API Contracts

`POST /api/scheduler/trigger` — **unchanged**. Same request schema, same response bodies, same status
codes:

| outcome | status | body |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enqueued` | 200 | `{ ok, jobId, message }` |
| `not_found` | 404 | `{ error }` |
| `forbidden` | 403 | `{ error }` |
| `strategy_unsupported` | 400 | `{ error, message }` |
| `failed` | 400 | `{ error }` |
| no actor | 401 | `{ error }` |

Only the `openApi` description text changed, to record that attempts are audited.

New action-log rows: `commandId: 'scheduler.jobs.trigger'`, `resourceKind: 'scheduler.job'`,
`resourceId` = the requested schedule id, `actionLabel` from `scheduler.audit.trigger`, and a
`commandPayload` carrying `scheduleName`, `targetType`, `target`, `outcome`, `queueJobId`, `error`.

## Risks & Impact Review

| Risk | Severity | Area | Mitigation | Residual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| The audit write happens after the enqueue and the bus does not guard it, so a failing audit store returns an error for a job that *was* queued; a user retry could double-run the schedule | Medium | `api/trigger` | Not swallowed — silently losing the row is the failure this change exists to prevent. The route logs the failure at error level so the run stays traceable | A retry after an audit-store outage can enqueue twice |
| Gating the effective actor **narrows** access: a user holding only `scheduler.jobs.trigger` can no longer manually run a command schedule authored by someone with broader features | Medium | trigger + worker RBAC | Intended — that path was privilege escalation through another user's authorization. The refusal is decided at trigger time, so the caller gets `403` and the audit row records `forbidden`; blast radius is one allowlisted command (`scheduler.test.echo`) | Deployments relying on that escalation see a visible refusal |
| Gating the effective actor **widens** access where the triggerer holds features the creator lacks | Low | worker RBAC | Intended and consistent with the invariant | None |
| An unattended command schedule whose creator has since lost the required features now ends as `scheduler.job.failed` instead of being retried | Low | worker RBAC | The retries could never succeed and left no trace but a log line; a failed event is the state an operator has to act on | Deployments watching for retry noise as the signal see a failed event instead |
| Queue-strategy and enqueue failures now also produce audit rows | Low | audit volume | Bounded by the trigger's own feature gate | Slightly more rows |
| A refused trigger writes a row naming a schedule id the caller cannot see | Low | `audit_logs` | Only the id is recorded, scoped to the caller's tenant; no attribute of the row is included | None |
| An attempt a `before` command interceptor blocks leaves **no** audit row — `CommandBus.execute` throws `CommandInterceptorError` before `buildLog`/`persistLog` run, so the "every authenticated attempt is audited" invariant has this one exception | Low | `api/trigger` | Bus-wide behaviour shared with `scheduler.jobs.create`/`.update`/`.delete`, not introduced here; the route surfaces the interceptor's own status and body so the refusal is visible to the caller, and the OpenAPI `errors` list declares it | An interceptor-blocked trigger is traceable only through the interceptor's own logging |

Not changed: database schema, ACL features, event ids, DI keys, response shapes.

## Testing

- `commands/__tests__/trigger.test.ts` — every outcome (`enqueued`, `not_found`, foreign-tenant
  `not_found`, `forbidden`, super-admin system-scope success, `strategy_unsupported`, `failed`),
  queue closed on both the success and failure paths, a close failure not failing a completed enqueue,
  API-key fallback, and `buildLog` output for a success and a refusal. Plus the trigger-time
  scheduled-command gate: an unauthorized actor gets `forbidden` with the schedule's details and no
  enqueue, the gate authorizes the actor the worker will resolve (the creator, for a key-only caller),
  a command schedule with no resolvable actor is refused, and a queue schedule bypasses the gate. Plus
  the refusal/outage split — a rejecting RBAC lookup gives `forbidden`, while a *failing* one and an
  unresolvable `rbacService` both give `failed`.
- `lib/__tests__/commandContext.test.ts` — triggering user wins, falls back to creator, then to the
  system actor; direct coverage of `resolveScheduledCommandActorUserId` including blank ids.
- `workers/__tests__/execute-schedule.worker.test.ts` — a manual run gates and executes as the
  triggerer; an unattended run still gates the creator; a triggering user on a `scheduled` payload is
  ignored; a triggerer lacking the target features is refused even when the creator holds them, and
  that refusal ends the job with a `scheduler.job.failed` event rather than throwing, while a failing
  RBAC lookup still throws so BullMQ retries it.
- `__integration__/TC-SCHED-009.spec.ts` — a manual trigger and a refused trigger each write an
  action-log row naming the caller. Independent of `QUEUE_STRATEGY`, because refusals are logged too.

## Backward Compatibility

No contract surface changes. `SchedulerCommandAuthorizationError` is an additive export and a subclass
of `Error`, so an existing `catch (error)` keeps working unchanged.

Two of the four messages it carries **did** change in this release — `Scheduled command requires an
authenticated creator` → `...actor`, and `Scheduled command creator is not authorized` → `...actor` —
following the identity the gate now authorizes. Those strings are diagnostic, not a contract: they are
neither user-facing nor translated, and nothing in the repo branches on them outside tests. Anything
that does should branch on the error type instead, which is why the type was introduced.

The command id and the `scheduler.audit.trigger` i18n key are additive;
the route's request/response shapes, status codes and feature gate are untouched. The behavior changes
are confined to which identity a manually triggered command schedule runs as, and which identity the
scheduler-safe-command gate authorizes — both described under Risks above.

## Changelog

- **2026-08-21** — Initial spec and implementation: `scheduler.jobs.trigger` audit command returning
  outcomes rather than throwing, trigger route reduced to an outcome→HTTP mapper, manual runs
  attributed to and authorized as the triggering user, `scheduler.audit.trigger` added to all five
  locales, unit coverage for every outcome plus `TC-SCHED-009`.
- **2026-08-26** — Review follow-up: the trigger route's OpenAPI `errors` list now declares the
  interceptor-chosen status a `before` command interceptor can return, and both route descriptions
  name the one attempt the audit invariant does not cover — an interceptor block, rejected before the
  command runs — now also recorded in the Risks table.
