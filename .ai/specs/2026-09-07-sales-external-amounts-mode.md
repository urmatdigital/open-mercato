## TLDR

Core's sales module is authoritative over money: a line's net is derived from `unitPriceNet × quantity`
minus the discount, and a document's header totals are derived from its lines. A caller that **mirrors**
documents already priced, rounded and taxed in an external book of record cannot transmit either figure —
both are recomputed over on every write, and there is no shape for a line whose net is *above*
`unitPrice × quantity`.

This spec proposes one opt-in, **persisted** mode — `sales_orders.totals_mode` and
`sales_order_lines.amounts_mode`, each `computed` (default) | `external` — under which the caller's
amounts are stored and served verbatim, and no recalculation path can move them — including the two
extension registries, which keep running but have the caller's amounts re-applied after them. It is
deliberately
**not** "honour a supplied `totalNetAmount`": that was #5644's option 1 and it was not taken, correctly,
because it freezes exactly the legacy rows #5640 heals. The distinguishing property here is that the
caller's authority is explicit and persisted, so recalculation can tell *a stored value that must be
healed* from *a stored value that is the truth*.

Zero behaviour change for any caller that never sets the mode. One default-valued column per table, no
backfill.

## Overview

Two questions need maintainer sign-off before an implementation PR exists, because both add a persisted
contract surface: whether the mode is worth a column at all (§ Proposed Solution 1), and what a command
that would rewrite an external document's header must do (§ Proposed Solution 6). Everything else follows
mechanically.

This is spec-only, on the same route
[`2026-08-07-sales-line-discount-amount-contract.md`](2026-08-07-sales-line-discount-amount-contract.md)
took: the contract is agreed first, the code follows in a separate change.

## Problem Statement

### What core owns today

`buildBaseLineResult` (`lib/calculations.ts:118`) derives a line's net from its own columns and nothing
else:

```ts
const netSubtotalBeforeDiscount = toNumber(unitNet, 0) * quantity          // :126
const discountTotal = Math.min(
  Math.max(resolveLineDiscountTotal(line, netSubtotalBeforeDiscount, quantity), 0),
  netSubtotalBeforeDiscount,                                               // :127-130
)
const netSubtotal = Math.max(netSubtotalBeforeDiscount - discountTotal, 0) // :131
```

`line.totalNetAmount` is never read. `line.totalGrossAmount`, by contrast, **is** honoured verbatim
(`:168-171`) — the asymmetry #5644 opened and #5853 still carries.

`buildBaseDocumentResult` (`:192`) then derives the header from the line *results*:

```ts
for (const line of lines) {
  subtotalNet += toNumber(line.netAmount, 0)                               // :213-222
  subtotalGross += toNumber(line.grossAmount, 0)
  discountTotal += toNumber(line.discountAmount, 0)
  taxTotal += toNumber(line.taxAmount, 0)
}
```

`applyOrderTotals` (`commands/documents.ts:3653`) writes **only** from `calculation.totals` onto the order
header; there is no branch anywhere that reads a caller-supplied header total for an order or a quote.

Every command that touches one line recalculates the whole document and re-persists every line:
`sales.orders.lines.upsert` builds `calcLines` from *all* the order's lines (`documents.ts:7297-7300`),
calls `calculateDocumentTotals` (`:7314`), then `applyOrderLineResults` (`:3230`) rewrites each row from
the result via `convertLineCalculationToEntityInput` (`:3142`) — `totalNetAmount: lineResult.netAmount`
at `:3185`, `totalGrossAmount: lineResult.grossAmount` at `:3186`. A persisted line re-enters calculation
through `mapPersistedLine` (`lib/lineSnapshots.ts:14`), rebuilt from its columns.

This is correct for a system that **composes** orders. It is wrong for one that **mirrors** orders whose
figures are the legally filed ones.

### Three consequences for a mirroring caller

1. **The line net cannot be transmitted.** A source that authors prices in gross stores a 2-decimal unit
   net which, multiplied by quantity, does not reproduce its own line net. The caller knows the true net
   and has nowhere to put it: `totalNetAmount` is accepted and validated (`data/validators.ts:349`) and
   then never read, and since #5640 a non-zero `discountPercent` takes precedence over any supplied
   `discountAmount` (`lib/calculations.ts:102-105`), so the amount channel is not available either.

2. **The header cannot be transmitted either.** Where the source rounds VAT per rate group, its own header
   net legitimately differs from the sum of its lines. `orderCreateSchema` *accepts* the header fields —
   `orderTotalsSchema.shape` is spread in at `data/validators.ts:731`, `quoteTotalsSchema.shape` at `:776`
   — and every write path then discards them and rewrites the header from the rollup. The difference is
   unrepresentable **regardless of how well the lines are fixed**. This is the same validated-then-ignored
   shape as #5644, one level up.

3. **Markups are unrepresentable.** `discountAmount` is `decimal({ min: 0 })` (`data/validators.ts:342`)
   and the engine clamps the resolved discount with `Math.max(…, 0)` (`lib/calculations.ts:128`), so a line
   whose net is *above* `unitPrice × quantity` — upward source rounding, a surcharge priced into the line —
   has no shape at either layer.

### How often this bites

Measured on one production-scale mirror of a several-million-line order history:

| observation | proportion |
|---|---:|
| lines where the derived line net differs from the source's | ~7% of all lines |
| the same, restricted to discounted lines | ~93% of discounted lines |
| orders where the source's own header net differs from the sum of its own lines | ~23% of orders |

Differences are typically one minor unit, occasionally larger. The structural point, not the magnitude, is
the argument: a difference of one minor unit on a legally filed document is a reconciliation failure, and
no amount of rounding-mode tuning closes a gap that the source deliberately introduced.

### Core already has caller-asserted amounts — on invoices

This is not a new principle for the module, only a new place to apply it. `sales.invoices.create`
(`commands/documents.ts:8977`) writes the header straight from request input:

```ts
subtotalNetAmount: toNumericString(parsed.subtotalNetAmount ?? 0),        // :9042
grandTotalNetAmount: toNumericString(parsed.grandTotalNetAmount ?? 0),    // :9046
```

`sales.invoices.update` (`:9256`), `sales.credit_memos.create` (`:9628`, `:9631`) and
`sales.credit_memos.update` (`:9802`) do the same. The discount contract's D1 records the matching
line-level position: `sales_invoice_lines.discount_amount` is *"caller-asserted and unenforced"* and stays
outside its normative contract.

So core already ships a document kind whose amounts belong to the caller. What it lacks is a way to say so
**explicitly**, on the document kind where it matters, and to have that statement survive the next write.

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Two persisted mode columns (normative)

> `sales_orders.totals_mode` and `sales_order_lines.amounts_mode` each hold `'computed'` (default) or
> `'external'`.
>
> `computed` — core derives the row's amounts, exactly as today.
>
> `external` — the amounts stored on the row are the caller's assertion. Core stores them, serves them,
> and never recomputes them. Core remains authoritative over everything that is not an amount:
> identifiers, statuses, quantities, `returned_quantity`, and the payment-derived
> `paid_total_amount` / `refunded_total_amount` / `outstanding_amount`.

Both columns, not one. The header finding and the line finding are independent, and neither column is
derivable from the other at the point of use:

- The line calculation is a pure function of one `SalesLineSnapshot` (`lib/calculations.ts:118`) with no
  document in scope. The snapshot is the only channel through which the engine can learn a line is
  external, and `mapPersistedLine` (`lib/lineSnapshots.ts:14`) is handed a line entity alone. A
  document-only mode would have to be fetched through a relation inside the mapper.
- A line-only mode cannot express the per-rate-group rounding difference, which exists only at the header.

The redundancy is real and is the cost of this shape. It is paid for by an invariant and a guard test:

> **Invariant.** `sales_orders.totals_mode = 'external'` **iff** every one of that order's lines has
> `amounts_mode = 'external'`. Mixed documents are rejected at the command layer.

Enforced in commands, not as a database constraint — a cross-table `CHECK` is not expressible and a trigger
would put document math outside `salesCalculationService`, against
`packages/core/src/modules/sales/AGENTS.md` rule 1.

**Quotes are deliberately excluded.** `sales_quotes` / `sales_quote_lines` get no column and
`quoteCreateSchema` gets no field: a quote is core *composing* a proposal, not mirroring a book of record.
The type and engine changes below are shared, so adding quotes later is one column and one optional schema
field — purely additive. Invoices and credit memos are excluded because they already behave this way
(§ Problem Statement → *Core already has caller-asserted amounts*); making their caller-asserted amounts
explicit is worthwhile and is separate work.

### 2. `amountsMode` on the snapshot — a third, orthogonal signal

`SalesLineSnapshot` already carries two fields that look adjacent and are not:

| field | question it answers | set by |
|---|---|---|
| `discountAmountBasis` (`lib/types.ts:66`) | *how* to read a supplied `discountAmount` — per unit or per line | callers only |
| `discountAmountFromStoredRow` (`:72`) | *where* the discount came from — a request or a persisted row | mappers only |
| `totalsFromStoredRow` (`:84`) | *where* the net and gross came from — same question, different field, added by #5707 | mappers only |
| **`amountsMode`** (new) | *who is authoritative* for this line's amounts | callers and mappers |

Three of these already exist, and the third is the precedent: #5707 needed an origin signal for the totals
and **added its own field rather than reusing the discount's**, because `lib/lineSnapshots.ts:33-38` is
emphatic that a mapper must not answer one origin question with the other's. `amountsMode` is the same
discipline applied once more — it is not an origin signal, and none of the other three is an authority
signal. Unlike the others, it **is** legitimately set by both producers: a caller declares it on create,
and `mapPersistedLine` reads it back off the column.

```ts
// packages/core/src/modules/sales/lib/types.ts
export type SalesAmountsMode = 'computed' | 'external'

export type SalesLineSnapshot = {
  // …
  /**
   * Who owns this line's amounts. `external` means the supplied net, gross and
   * tax are the caller's assertion: the engine returns them verbatim and never
   * derives them from unit price, quantity or discount. Omitted means
   * 'computed', which is the only behaviour the engine has ever had.
   */
  amountsMode?: SalesAmountsMode | null
}
```

Additive optional field on a public type → ADDITIVE-ONLY under `BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md` § 2.

### 3. Line calculation under `external`

`buildBaseLineResult` gains one early branch, before any derivation:

```
if line.amountsMode === 'external':
    netAmount   = line.totalNetAmount
    grossAmount = line.totalGrossAmount
    taxAmount   = line.taxAmount
    discountAmount = round(unitPriceNet × quantity − totalNetAmount)   # derived, signed
    return
```

Three properties of that block are load-bearing.

**No clamp.** The `Math.max(…, 0)` at `:128` and the `Math.min(…, netSubtotalBeforeDiscount)` at `:127` do
not run, so a line net *above* `unitPrice × quantity` is expressible. The markup arrives as a **negative
derived `discountAmount`**, which the `numeric(18,4)` column holds without a schema change.

**No validator change for the markup.** `discountAmount: decimal({ min: 0 })` (`data/validators.ts:342`)
constrains a *caller input*, and under `external` the caller does not supply `discountAmount` — it is
derived from the net it did supply. The `min: 0` bound therefore stays exactly as it is. This is a
deliberate improvement on the obvious fix of relaxing the bound, which would also loosen the computed path.

**`discountAmount` stays derived** rather than becoming a fourth supplied field, so an items table that
renders both a percent and an amount keeps agreeing with itself, and the document rollup keeps summing a
quantity-inclusive line total exactly as D1 fixed it.

**Registered line calculators still run, and cannot move the amounts.** `calculateLine` (`:359`) runs
`buildBaseLineResult` first (`:361`), then the `sales.line.calculate.before` event, then the hook registry
(`:375-378`), then `.after`. Substituting at the first stage only would leave any later stage free to
overwrite the caller's figures, so `calculateLine` **re-applies** an external line's supplied `netAmount`,
`grossAmount` and `taxAmount` after the registry, immediately before returning.

That is not a new pattern: `calculateDocument` already does exactly this for `paidTotalAmount` /
`refundedTotalAmount` (`:456-467`), for exactly this reason — *"Totals calculators rebuild the document
result from lines+adjustments and would otherwise reset paid/refunded to 0"* (`:450-455`). Authoritative
inputs are re-applied last. A supplied amount under `external` is an authoritative input by definition.

Hooks keep running, so the extension point `BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md` treats as stable is not silently
disabled, and a hook may still attach line-level `adjustments`. It simply cannot change what the caller
asserted. § Decision Requested question 3 asks whether that is the right trade against commercetools'
blunter *"Cart Discounts are deactivated for Line Items with this price mode"*.

### 4. Document totals under `external`

The supplied header reaches the engine through two additive fields on `CalculateDocumentOptions`
(`lib/types.ts:175`), which today has no channel for it at all:

```ts
export type CalculateDocumentOptions = {
  // …
  totalsMode?: SalesAmountsMode | null
  suppliedTotals?: Partial<SalesDocumentAmounts> | null
}
```

`buildBaseDocumentResult` (`:192`) then takes the supplied header instead of the line rollup, for nine of
the ten fields `orderTotalsSchema` (`data/validators.ts:662`) accepts: `subtotalNetAmount`,
`subtotalGrossAmount`, `discountTotalAmount`, `taxTotalAmount`, `shippingNetAmount`,
`shippingGrossAmount`, `surchargeTotalAmount`, `grandTotalNetAmount`, `grandTotalGrossAmount`.

The tenth, `lineItemCount` (`validators.ts:672`), stays **core-owned** and is not caller-supplied. It is
not money — it is a count of rows core itself persisted, derived from `calculation.lines.length` at
`commands/documents.ts:3678` — and a caller that could assert it could make a document disagree with its
own line rows. Named here because it sits in the same schema as the nine and an implementer wiring "the
header totals" through wholesale would carry it along.

**Substituting there is necessary and not sufficient**, because a totals calculator runs afterwards and
rebuilds the header from scratch. Core registers one itself, and it arrives by import rather than by call:
`lib/providers/index.ts:5` runs `ensureProviderTotalsCalculator()` (`lib/providers/totals.ts:179`) at
module-evaluation time. Two independent paths evaluate that barrel:

- `packages/core/src/modules/sales/index.ts:2` — a bare `import './lib/providers'` in the **module entry
  point**, so loading the sales module at all registers the hook;
- `data/validators.ts:6` — a **value** import of `getPaymentProvider` / `getShippingProvider`, which
  `commands/documents.ts` pulls in transitively when it imports `orderLineCreateSchema` and friends
  (`:82-98`).

The type-only import at `commands/documents.ts:122-125` is *not* one of them — `import type` is erased and
triggers nothing. Worth stating, because it is the reference a grep for `lib/providers` in the command file
surfaces first, and it is the one that does not count.

So the hook at `lib/providers/totals.ts:183` is live on **every** order and quote write. Its first act
discards the base result entirely:

```ts
let working = rebuildDocumentResult({            // totals.ts:191
  documentKind, currencyCode: current.currencyCode, lines,
  adjustments: runningAdjustments, metadata: current.metadata,
})
```

`rebuildDocumentResult` (`calculations.ts:505`) calls `buildBaseDocumentResult` with lines and adjustments
only — there is no channel for supplied totals — and the hook returns `working` at `totals.ts:370`
whether or not a shipping or payment method is set. `calculateDocument` runs the registered totals
calculators after the base result (`:425-434`) and returns their output, which is what `applyOrderTotals`
persists. Left unaddressed, the caller's header is replaced by the sum of its lines before anything is
written, and acceptance criterion 3 cannot pass.

Two changes close it, and neither disables the registry:

1. **`calculateDocument` re-applies the supplied header after the totals-calculator stage**, in the same
   final block that already re-applies `paidTotalAmount` / `refundedTotalAmount` (`:456-467`) — today gated
   on `existingTotals`, extended to run whenever `totalsMode === 'external'`. `outstandingAmount` is then
   recomputed against the restored gross, exactly as that block already does. This is the belt: whatever a
   third-party calculator does, the caller's header is restored last.
2. **Core's own provider totals calculator returns `current` unchanged for an external document.** This is
   the braces, and it is a correctness point rather than a defensive one: the hook exists to generate
   shipping and payment *provider adjustments*, and generating an adjustment whose amount cannot move a
   header the caller already supplied would put a shipping charge on the document that is visible in the
   itemised breakdown and absent from the total.

Third-party totals calculators still run and may still append adjustments; they cannot move an external
header. A calculator that needs to must switch the document to `computed` first.

`paidTotalAmount`, `refundedTotalAmount` and `outstandingAmount` stay **core-owned** and derived, unchanged:
`outstandingAmount = max(grandTotalGross − paid + refunded, 0)` (`lib/calculations.ts:314`, re-applied at
`:456-467`; `commands/payments.ts:316` recomputes it from `order.grandTotalGrossAmount` and the payment
rows). Because payments derive outstanding from the *persisted* header gross and never re-derive the
header, **`sales.payments.*` needs no rule and no change at all** — under `external` it simply derives from
the caller's gross instead of core's.

Choosing `external` **requires** a complete specification: `unitPriceNet`, net, gross and tax on every
line, and the header totals on the document. Partial specification is not a mode. This mirrors
commercetools' rule for `TaxMode: ExternalAmount` — *"A Cart can be ordered only if the Cart and all Line
Items, Custom Line Items, and the Shipping Method have an external tax amount and rate set."*

**`unitPriceNet` is on that list because § 3's derivation consumes it**, not for symmetry. It is optional
on the request (`data/validators.ts:337`) and `mapPersistedLine` coerces a missing one to zero
(`lib/lineSnapshots.ts:30`, via a `toNumeric` that returns `0` for null), so an external line that omits it
derives `discountAmount = 0 × quantity − totalNetAmount = −totalNetAmount`: the line's entire net,
persisted into `sales_order_lines.discount_amount` and rendered in the items table as a discount. That is
exactly the self-consistency § 3 keeps the discount derived in order to protect, and a mirroring caller has
every reason to omit the field — under `external` core uses the unit price for nothing else the caller can
observe. Requiring it is also the honest reading of the mode: a source that authors in gross does hold a
unit net (§ Problem Statement), so nothing is being asked for that the caller does not have.

A caller that genuinely has no unit price should not use `external` on that line; there is no
partially-specified variant, by § 4's own rule.

### 5. Round trip

`mapPersistedLine` (`lib/lineSnapshots.ts:14`) reads `amounts_mode` off the column onto the snapshot, so
every rehydration is self-describing. Combined with § 3 and § 4:

- Recalculation triggered by a sibling line's write returns the external line's stored amounts unchanged.
- The persisted-totals reconciliation and the #5707 divergence warning skip external rows — structurally,
  because § 3's branch returns before `lib/calculations.ts:143` ever runs (§ Out of Scope).
- The read path needs no change at all: `sales.orders` single-row `GET` already serves persisted totals
  rather than recomputing, since *"fix(sales): serve persisted order totals on single-row GET (#5438)"*
  (`136748c73`) removed the display recalculation from `api/documents/factory.ts`.
  `recalculateOrderTotalsForDisplay` (`commands/returns.ts:176`) survives as an export with **no production
  caller** on `develop` @ `3076e5ccf`.

**This is the property that separates the proposal from every write-time-only variant.** A request flag can
make one write correct; only a persisted column survives the next write to a sibling row.

### 6. Every place that writes header totals, and its rule

Exhaustive at `3076e5ccf`. **Twenty-three sites: twenty-two command-layer writers, and one inside the
calculation engine.** Two of the groups below are invisible to a grep for `applyOrderTotals`, which is the
helper the first three tables are built on: the totals-calculator stage of § 4, registered as a module side
effect, and the undo path, which assigns the header field by field. The rule is one sentence, applied
uniformly:

> A command that would rewrite an external document's header either **refuses**, or **leaves the header
> untouched** and records its own non-monetary effect. Nothing recomputes an external header implicitly.

**Which mode the rules are evaluated against, because it is load-bearing and every row below depends on
it:** the **persisted** `totals_mode`, as it stands when the command starts — *except* for a request that
sets `totalsMode` itself, which is a mode transition and is governed by § 8 rather than by the row for the
command carrying it. Without that carve-out the § 8 switch-back falls through `sales.orders.update`'s row
below (it carries neither lines nor totals) and is told to leave the header untouched, which would leave a
document holding externally-asserted amounts while both columns say `computed` — the same end state the
undo discussion below exists to prevent, reached through a different door.

Both transitions are legal and both recompute or rewrite as § 8 describes:

| transition | how | effect |
|---|---|---|
| `computed → external` | `totalsMode: 'external'` with complete lines and header totals (§ 4) | the supplied amounts are stored verbatim; incomplete input is a 4xx and the document stays `computed` |
| `external → computed` | `totalsMode: 'computed'`, carrying nothing else | § 8's switch-back: every line flips, header and lines are recomputed, and the caller's figures are gone |

**`commands/documents.ts` — recalculate-and-persist via `applyOrderTotals` (`:3653`) / `applyQuoteTotals` (`:3634`)**

| command | decl | writes at | rule under `external` |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `sales.orders.create` | 5714 | 5990 | accepts `totalsMode: 'external'` + complete lines + header totals; incomplete input is a 4xx |
| `sales.orders.update` | 5470 | 5603 | if the request carries lines or totals it must carry **both**; a request carrying neither leaves the persisted header untouched — **unless it sets `totalsMode`, which is a transition and follows § 8, not this row** |
| `sales.orders.lines.upsert` | 7076 | 7340 | **reject** unless the request also carries the document header totals — which today's schema cannot express, so § API Contracts widens it |
| `sales.orders.lines.delete` | 7396 | 7522 | **reject** unless the request also carries the document header totals — same schema widening |
| `sales.orders.adjustments.upsert` | 8047 | 8284 | **refuse** — an adjustment exists only to change money |
| `sales.orders.adjustments.delete` | 8341 | 8449 | **refuse** — same |
| `sales.quotes.create` | 4718 | 4960 | unchanged — quotes are always `computed` (§ 1) |
| `sales.quotes.update` | 5237 | 5380 | unchanged |
| `sales.quotes.lines.upsert` | 7578 | 7837 | unchanged |
| `sales.quotes.lines.delete` | 7893 | 7991 | unchanged |
| `sales.quotes.adjustments.upsert` | 8506 | 8741 | unchanged |
| `sales.quotes.adjustments.delete` | 8798 | 8905 | unchanged |

**`commands/documents.ts` — copies a header rather than deriving one**

| command | decl | writes at | rule |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `sales.quotes.convert_to_order` | 6326 | 6500–6515 | copies the quote's persisted totals onto the new order without recalculating; the produced order is `computed`, because its source was |

**`commands/returns.ts` — recalculate-and-persist via the returns-local `applyOrderTotals` (`:121`)**

| site | enclosing symbol | reached from | rule under `external` |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 395 → `em.persist(order)` 397 | `reverseReturnEffects` (`:314`) | `sales.returns.create` (`:796`), `sales.returns.delete` (`:1027`) | record the return; **skip the header write** |
| 545 → `em.persist(order)` 547 | `restoreReturnEffects` (`:411`) | `sales.returns.create` (`:811`), `sales.returns.delete` (`:1085`) | same |
| 731 → `tx.persist(order)` 733 | `sales.returns.create` (`:571`) | — | same |

**`commands/documents.ts` — undo/rollback via `restoreOrderGraph`, which bypasses `applyOrderTotals` entirely**

`restoreOrderGraph` (`:4358`) calls `applyOrderSnapshot` (`:3983`), which assigns the header field by field
— `subtotalNetAmount` at `:4039` through `lineItemCount` at `:4054` — without going near
`applyOrderTotals`. Every order command in the first table has a second, unlisted header write behind it:

| undo handler | restore at | rule under `external` |
|---|---:|---|
| `sales.orders.update` | 5705 | restore the mode columns **together with** the amounts |
| `sales.orders.delete` | 6311 | same |
| `sales.orders.lines.upsert` | 7387 | same |
| `sales.orders.lines.delete` | 7569 | same |
| `sales.orders.adjustments.upsert` | 8332 | same |
| `sales.orders.adjustments.delete` | 8497 | same |

**The amounts are not the hazard here — the mode columns are.** An undo restores the row's own previously
persisted values, which for an external order are the caller's. But `OrderGraphSnapshot` (`:329`) and its
nested `OrderLineSnapshot` (`:395`) are hand-maintained explicit field lists — the line entry already
spells out `unitPriceNet` (`:417`), `discountAmount` (`:419`), `totalNetAmount` (`:423`) and
`totalGrossAmount` (`:424`) — captured by `loadOrderSnapshot` (`:1801`) and restored by
`applyOrderSnapshot`, field by field at both ends. `totals_mode` and `amounts_mode` have to be added to
all three or they are silently dropped across an undo.

The concrete failure, and it is the one this whole spec exists to prevent: an operator uses § 8's
switch-back to flip an external order to `computed`, so `sales.orders.update` recomputes the header and
every line and sets both columns to `computed`. The operator then undoes that update. `restoreOrderGraph`
puts the caller's amounts back but, with the columns absent from the snapshot, leaves
`totals_mode = 'computed'`. The document now holds the caller's legally filed header while advertising
that core owns it — and the next write to any sibling line recalculates it away, silently. The
mirror-image miss (column captured, amounts restored from a `computed`-era snapshot) produces the mixed
state § 1's invariant forbids.

So the rule is not "restore the mode" but **restore the mode and the amounts as one unit**: the pair must
never be observably inconsistent, in either direction.

`applyQuoteSnapshot` (`:3926`) is the quote twin, reached from seven quote-side handlers. Under § 1 quotes
stay `computed`, so it needs no rule — but it is named here so the next reader does not have to
re-establish that it was considered.

**Inside the engine — the twenty-third site**

| site | symbol | reached from | rule under `external` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lib/providers/totals.ts:183`, rebuild at `:191`, returns at `:370` | the provider totals calculator, registered by `ensureProviderTotalsCalculator` (`:179`) via the `lib/providers/index.ts:5` module side effect | every order and quote write — the barrel is evaluated by `sales/index.ts:2` and by `data/validators.ts:6` (§ 4) | return `current` unchanged; and `calculateDocument` re-applies the supplied header after the whole registry regardless (§ 4) |

This last one is the reason § 4 is written as belt *and* braces. Every other site in this section is a command
that can be guarded where it is called; this one is a hook installed by *importing a module*, so a guard
placed at any call site would miss it, and so would a review that only reads the command files.

`sales.returns.update` (`:859`) writes no header totals today and needs no rule.

A return against an external order still creates its return document, its line-level `return` adjustments
and its `returned_quantity` update — it simply does not rewrite the header. **This is the most surprising
rule in the spec and it is deliberate**: the header belongs to the source system, which issues its own
credit document and pushes the corrected header. Silently moving a legally filed total because core
computed a credit would be worse than leaving it. § Decision Requested question 2 offers the alternative
(refuse returns on external orders outright).

### 7. UI

`components/documents/DocumentTotals.tsx` and `components/documents/ItemsSection.tsx`, reached from
`backend/sales/orders/[id]/page.tsx` and `backend/sales/documents/[id]/page.tsx`:

- an "amounts from source" badge on the document header when `totals_mode = 'external'`, its label routed
  through `t('sales.documents.amountsExternal')` per the i18n rule;
- amount fields rendered read-only on an external document, since a write would be rejected anyway
  (§ 6) and a form that submits into a guaranteed 4xx is a defect;
- switching back to `computed` is an explicit, confirmed action (§ Proposed Solution 8), never a side
  effect of an edit.

Status colours use `{property}-status-{status}-{role}` tokens; no hardcoded Tailwind shades.

### 8. Leaving the mode, and what is not kept

Setting `totalsMode: 'computed'` on `sales.orders.update` flips the order and **all** its lines
(the § 1 invariant forbids the mixed state), runs `calculateDocumentTotals` normally, and rewrites the
header and every line from `unit_price_net`, `quantity` and `discount_*`.

**The switch is lossy, and how lossy depends on the line.** Three cases, and only the first is exact:

- **A discount line with `discount_percent = 0` round-trips exactly.** `mapPersistedLine` sets
  `discountAmountFromStoredRow: true` (`lib/lineSnapshots.ts:38`), so `resolveLineDiscountTotal` reads the
  stored amount as a line total rather than multiplying it out. Since § 3 derived that amount as
  `unitPriceNet × quantity − totalNetAmount`, the recomputed net is
  `unitPriceNet × quantity − (unitPriceNet × quantity − totalNetAmount) = totalNetAmount`. The caller's net
  survives. This is the reason § 3 derives the discount instead of storing zero.
- **A markup line loses the markup, and its net falls.** Its derived `discount_amount` is negative;
  `Math.max(…, 0)` at `lib/calculations.ts:128` clamps that to `0`, so
  `netSubtotal = unitPriceNet × quantity`, which for a markup line is *below* the external net by
  definition. The markup is exactly what is lost.
- **A line carrying a non-zero `discount_percent` re-derives from the percent.** Percentage-first
  precedence (`lib/calculations.ts:102-105`) outranks the stored amount, so the net becomes whatever the
  percent implies and the derived-discount identity above does not hold. `discount_percent` is persisted
  as supplied but unused while the line is external, which makes it a latent trap: a caller that sends one
  alongside external amounts gets an exact round-trip while external and a silently different net the
  moment the document is switched back.

The header returns to the line rollup in every case, so the per-rate-group difference the mode existed to
carry is gone regardless of which case the lines fall into.

The supplied values are **not** retained in shadow columns. A shadow copy is a second source of truth that
nothing reads and nothing keeps correct, and the caller's own book of record still holds the originals.
`totals_snapshot` (`data/entities.ts`, jsonb) holds the last calculation result and is overwritten like any
other derived field. The UI confirmation in § 7 is what makes the loss deliberate rather than accidental.

```

The two `re-apply` stages are the load-bearing part, and they are why the engine-side site in § 6 exists.
Substituting only at `buildBaseLineResult` / `buildBaseDocumentResult` leaves both registries free to
overwrite the caller's figures afterwards — and core installs a totals calculator into its own registry by
module side effect, so that is not a hypothetical third-party concern but the default path.

`salesCalculationService` remains the sole owner of document math (`sales/AGENTS.md` rule 1): the mode is
read inside the engine, and no call site recomputes anything inline. The command-layer guards in § 6 decide
whether a write is *permitted*, never what the numbers are.

## Data Models

Two new columns, each with a default. No backfill, no data migration.

| entity | column | definition |
|---|---|---|
| `SalesOrder` (`data/entities.ts:333`, table `sales_orders`) | `totals_mode` | `text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'computed'` |
| `SalesOrderLine` (`data/entities.ts:555`, table `sales_order_lines`) | `amounts_mode` | `text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'computed'` |

Declared in the style the module already uses for `kind` (`data/entities.ts:571`):

```ts
export type SalesAmountsMode = 'computed' | 'external'

@Property({ name: 'totals_mode', type: 'text', default: 'computed' })
totalsMode: SalesAmountsMode = 'computed'
```

Unchanged, and listed because § 3 depends on their existing shape:

| entity | column | definition (unchanged) |
|---|---|---|
| `SalesOrderLine` | `discount_amount` | `numeric(18,4) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0'` (`:634`) — now signed on external rows |
| `SalesOrderLine` | `total_net_amount` | `numeric(18,4) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0'` (`:646`) |
| `SalesOrderLine` | `total_gross_amount` | `numeric(18,4) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0'` (`:649`) |
| `SalesOrder` | `grand_total_gross_amount` | `numeric(18,4) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0'` |
| `SalesOrder` | `outstanding_amount` | `numeric(18,4) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0'` — stays derived (§ 4) |

`numeric` is signed, so the markup case (§ 3) needs no type change.

**Two module-private types must gain the columns too**, or the undo path drops them (§ 6):

| type | file:line | add |
|---|---|---|
| `OrderGraphSnapshot` | `commands/documents.ts:329` | `totalsMode` |
| `OrderLineSnapshot` | `commands/documents.ts:395` | `amountsMode` |

Both are hand-maintained explicit field lists, captured by `loadOrderSnapshot` (`:1801`) and restored by
`applyOrderSnapshot` (`:3983`) field by field at both ends, so a new column is not picked up implicitly.
Neither type is exported, so this is not a contract change — but the undo *behaviour* it drives is
observable, which is why the rule lives in § 6 rather than here.

The generated migration adds two `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN … DEFAULT 'computed' NOT NULL` statements and
updates `packages/core/src/modules/sales/migrations/.snapshot-open-mercato.json`. Existing rows take the
default in place; PostgreSQL has not rewritten a table for a defaulted column add since 11.

## API Contracts

No route is added, removed or renamed. No response shape changes beyond two additive fields.

| route | methods | change |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/sales/orders` (`api/documents/factory.ts`) | `POST` `PUT` | accepts `totalsMode` on the document and `amountsMode` on each line; header total fields, already accepted (`validators.ts:731`), become meaningful under `external` |
| `/api/sales/orders` | `GET` | responses gain `totalsMode` on the document and `amountsMode` on each line |
| `/api/sales/order-lines` (`api/order-lines/route.ts` → `sales.orders.lines.*`) | `POST` `PUT` `DELETE` | on an external order, requires the document header totals in the same request (§ 6); otherwise unchanged |
| `/api/sales/order-adjustments` → `sales.orders.adjustments.*` | `POST` `PUT` `DELETE` | refuses on an external order (§ 6) |
| `/api/sales/returns` → `sales.returns.*` | `POST` `DELETE` | succeeds on an external order; leaves the header untouched (§ 6) |
| `/api/sales/quotes`, `/api/sales/quote-lines` | all | unchanged |

**Each field is named after the column it sets, and is returned under the name it is accepted under.**
The document carries `totalsMode` (`sales_orders.totals_mode`); a line carries `amountsMode`
(`sales_order_lines.amounts_mode`). Two names rather than one is deliberate: a document has *totals* and a
line has *amounts*, they are separate columns (§ 1), and a field accepted under one name and returned
under another is the adjacent shape to the bug this whole document is about — see the note below on
`orderLineCreateSchema`.

`totalsMode` is the caller-facing switch and **cascades**: setting it writes the document column and every
line's column, which is what makes § 1's invariant hold by construction rather than by validation, and
what makes § 8's switch-back a single field on a single request rather than one per line. A line-level
`amountsMode` is still accepted — it has to be, because `sales.orders.lines.upsert` addresses one line
without the document — and if an explicitly supplied line mode disagrees with the document's, the request
is rejected (`sales.errors.externalModeMixed`) rather than one silently winning.

Request schema additions — two in `data/validators.ts`:

```ts
// linePricingSchema (:332-351), spread into orderLineCreateSchema and its update partial
amountsMode: z.enum(['computed', 'external']).optional(),   // new; omitted ⇒ inherit the document
                                                            // on a document write, 'computed' otherwise

// orderCreateSchema (:687), alongside the existing ...orderTotalsSchema.shape (:731)
totalsMode: z.enum(['computed', 'external']).optional(),    // new; omitted ⇒ 'computed'
```

— and two in `commands/documents.ts`, without which § 6's rule for the line commands is one **no caller
can satisfy**. Neither schema can carry a header total today:

```ts
const orderLineUpsertSchema = orderLineCreateSchema.extend({   // :6793 — line fields only
  id: z.string().uuid().optional(),
})
const orderLineDeleteSchema = z.object({                        // :6797
  id: z.string().uuid(),
  orderId: z.string().uuid(),
})
```

Both gain the header totals as an optional group, required only when the target order is `external`:

```ts
const orderLineUpsertSchema = orderLineCreateSchema.extend({
  id: z.string().uuid().optional(),
  orderTotals: orderTotalsSchema.optional(),   // new; required iff the order is external
})
const orderLineDeleteSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().uuid(),
  orderId: z.string().uuid(),
  orderTotals: orderTotalsSchema.optional(),   // new; required iff the order is external
})
```

A nested `orderTotals` object rather than spreading `orderTotalsSchema.shape` flat: a line command's own
payload already carries `totalNetAmount` and `totalGrossAmount` for the *line*, and flattening
document-level fields beside them would put two different meanings of "total" in one object.
`orderTotalsSchema` is currently module-private (`data/validators.ts:662`) and needs exporting.

`quoteLineUpsertSchema` / `quoteLineDeleteSchema` are unchanged — quotes stay `computed` (§ 1).

`linePricingSchema` is shared with `quoteLineCreateSchema`. Per § 1 quotes stay `computed`, so the quote
line commands must reject a supplied `amountsMode` rather than silently ignore it — silently ignoring an
accepted field is the exact failure #5644 exists to name.

Omitting the field reproduces today's behaviour exactly, so no existing caller changes.

New error keys, routed through i18n per the project rule:
`sales.errors.externalAmountsIncomplete`, `sales.errors.externalTotalsRequired`,
`sales.errors.externalAdjustmentRefused`, `sales.errors.externalModeMixed`.

## Migration & Backward Compatibility

Contract surfaces touched, classified per `BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md`:

| surface | classification | note |
|---|---|---|
| `SalesLineSnapshot`, `SalesAmountsMode` (public types) | **ADDITIVE-ONLY** | one optional field; no deprecation bridge required |
| `CalculateDocumentOptions` (public type) | **ADDITIVE-ONLY** | two optional fields, `totalsMode` and `suppliedTotals` (§ 4) |
| `SalesTotalsCalculationHook` contract | **STABLE, unchanged signature** | the hook's *output* stops being final for an external document, because the supplied header is re-applied after the registry (§ 4). No third-party calculator has to change; one that deliberately moved an external header would stop being able to — see § Risks |
| Line and document validators | **ADDITIVE-ONLY** | optional field; omission = today's behaviour |
| `orderLineUpsertSchema`, `orderLineDeleteSchema` (`commands/documents.ts:6793`, `:6797`) | **ADDITIVE-ONLY** | one optional nested `orderTotals` group each |
| DB schema | **ADDITIVE-ONLY** | two new columns with defaults — explicitly permitted: *"MAY add new columns with defaults (non-breaking)"* (§ 8) |
| API routes / URLs | unchanged | — |
| API responses | **ADDITIVE-ONLY** | two new fields |
| Event ids, DI keys, ACL features, notification ids, CLI commands | unchanged | — |

**There is no behavioural break.** Every rule in § 6 is gated on `totals_mode = 'external'`, which no
existing row holds and no existing caller sets. That is stated as acceptance criterion 1 rather than left
as a hope.

Two consequences are worth an `UPGRADE_NOTES.md` line even so, because both are visible to code that never
opts in:

| what | who sees it |
|---|---|
| `sales_order_lines.discount_amount` can be **negative** on external rows | a third-party module or report that assumed the column is non-negative |
| `GET /api/sales/orders` responses gain `totalsMode` / `amountsMode` | a consumer with a strict response schema |

**The migration-cost objection, answered directly.** The discount contract's § Alternatives rejected its
variant D — a persisted assertion via a nullable column — *"on migration cost only"*, with
*"revisit only if § Proposed Solution 2's cost is judged unacceptable"*. This spec is that revisit,
generalised from one column to the document, and the cost objection does not carry across: D needed
`discount_amount` migrated to nullable **and** `0 → NULL` backfilled across every existing row, rewriting
data whose meaning was already ambiguous. This needs one default-valued column per table, no backfill, no
rewrite of any existing value, and no behaviour change for a caller that never sets it. The nullable-column
cost was the whole of the objection, and it is not incurred here.

## Prior Art

The shape is standard in platforms that must interoperate with an external book of record. Every source
below was opened and quoted verbatim.

### commercetools — the closest precedent

Authoritative by default, with an explicit, persisted opt-out at both levels. This is the same two-level
structure § 1 proposes, arrived at independently.

**`LineItemPriceMode`** ([type definition](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-api-reference/blob/be3dc3f9e725eef0c85f8e6084f096878d4a354c/api-specs/api/types/cart/LineItemPriceMode.raml),
rendered at [docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/carts](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/carts#lineitempricemode)):

> `Platform`: The price is selected from the Product Variant. This is the default mode.
>
> `ExternalTotal`: The Line Item price with the total is set externally. Cart Discounts are deactivated for
> Line Items with this price mode […]. Although a Line Item with this price mode has both `price` and
> `totalPrice` set externally, only `totalPrice` is used to calculate the total price of a Cart.

Two things to take from it. The mode is a persisted enum on the line with `Platform` as the default —
§ 1's shape exactly. And *"Cart Discounts are deactivated"* is precedent for suppressing the platform's own
line-level extensions on an external line, which § 3 declines and § Decision Requested question 3 puts to
the maintainer.

**`TaxMode: ExternalAmount`** ([type definition](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-api-reference/blob/be3dc3f9e725eef0c85f8e6084f096878d4a354c/api-specs/api/types/cart/TaxMode.raml)):

> Tax amounts, Tax Rates, and tax portions are set externally with `ExternalTaxAmountDraft`. A Cart can be
> ordered only if the Cart **and all** Line Items, Custom Line Items, and the Shipping Method have an
> external tax amount and rate set.
>
> Price-affecting update actions on Carts require external recalculation of the total gross price. In these
> cases, `taxedPrice` and `taxRate` are removed and must be set again.

The first sentence is § 4's completeness requirement. The second is the same problem § Decision Requested
question 1 answers, resolved the other way — see there.

**`Set Cart Total Tax`** ([type definition](https://github.com/commercetools/commercetools-api-reference/blob/4c16ce73d5391802f2cf109581ac962749c027a5/api-specs/api/types/cart/updates/CartSetCartTotalTaxAction.raml)):

> Can be used if the Cart has the `ExternalAmount` `TaxMode`. This update action adds the `taxedPrice`
> field to the Cart. It sets the `totalGross` amount […]. **You must use this update action after any
> price-affecting change occurs within the Cart.**
>
> `externalTaxPortions?` — Set if the `externalTotalGross` price is a sum of portions with different tax
> rates.

A header total supplied separately from the lines, carrying per-rate portions, precisely because the two do
not have to agree. That is § Problem Statement consequence 2 as a shipped API.

And, from the tax-integration guide
([docs.commercetools.com/tutorials/tax-integration](https://docs.commercetools.com/tutorials/tax-integration)):

> **To eliminate any possible rounding discrepancies between the commercetools Cart and the tax provider
> reporting, we recommend that you use `ExternalAmount`.**

A platform that owns money by default recommends its external mode *specifically* for the rounding problem
this spec opens with.

### Shopify and Saleor — the ceiling

Import-first paths that take supplied amounts as facts with no mode at all.

Shopify's `orderCreate`
([shopify.dev](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/orderCreate)):

> Use the `orderCreate` mutation to programmatically generate orders in scenarios where orders aren't
> created through the standard checkout process, such as when importing orders from an external system or
> creating orders for wholesale customers.

Saleor's `orderBulkCreate`
([docs.saleor.io](https://docs.saleor.io/developer/bulks/bulk-orders)):

> `totalPrice` and `undiscountedTotalPrice` are the primary sources of truth about the order pricing. Based
> on the fields, Saleor calculates unit price, undiscounted unit price, unit discount amount, order total
> and subtotal.
>
> […] it doesn't trigger any price recalculation. Prices are based only on line totals.

Saleor **inverts** core's derivation: the totals are the input and the unit price is derived. These set the
ceiling, not the target — platforms that import give up derivation entirely. This proposal asks for far
less: derivation stays the default and stays untouched for every caller that does not opt out.

### Odoo — the cautionary case

A bill's tax total can be edited to match the supplier's paper document. The field is
`account.move.tax_totals`
([`addons/account/models/account_move.py`, tag `18.0`](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/18.0/addons/account/models/account_move.py)):

```python
tax_totals = fields.Binary(
    string="Invoice Totals",
    compute='_compute_tax_totals',
    inverse='_inverse_tax_totals',
    help='Edit Tax amounts if you encounter rounding issues.',
    exportable=False,
)
```

The help text names this spec's problem exactly. But the field is **computed**, and the edit is not stored
as an assertion: `_inverse_tax_totals` pushes the delta back onto a tax line
(`first_tax_line.amount_currency -= delta_amount * sign`) and then calls `self._compute_amount()`. Nothing
on the record says "these amounts are the supplier's", so the next recomputation from the lines governs.

That is the failure mode of **every write-time-only variant**, including the discount contract's
Alternative E, and it is why § Proposed Solution 1 insists on a persisted column rather than a request
flag.

## Out of Scope

**#5644 option 1 — "honour a supplied `totalNetAmount`" — is not being asked for, and must not be.**
#5644 offered three directions; option 1 was not taken; #5707 implemented option 3, validate-and-warn, and merged on 2026-09-08.
Honouring a supplied net *by default* would freeze exactly the legacy rows the discount contract heals on
recalculation (`.ai/specs/2026-08-07-…` § Row reconciliation). That objection is correct. Under this
proposal a supplied net is honoured **only** on a row that carries an explicit, persisted `external` mode;
every `computed` row keeps recalculating and keeps healing.

**The discount contract's Alternative E is not being reopened.** D4 declined it on the grounds that
precedence would key off a field's *presence* rather than its value, and recorded that it stays adoptable
later as a purely additive change. Nothing here depends on it or revisits it. E is also, on its own merits,
insufficient for this problem: it is write-time only, so the next write to a sibling line recalculates from
the stored percent and overwrites the value — the Odoo failure above.

**#5853 is referenced, not decided.** Whether a caller-supplied `totalGrossAmount` should keep being
honoured verbatim on the `computed` path stays open. One observation, offered as input rather than as an
answer: today's net/gross asymmetry (`lib/calculations.ts:168-171` honours gross, nothing honours net) is
an argument for a single explicit mode over per-field verbatim rules, because under `external` net and
gross are symmetric by construction and there is no asymmetry left to justify.

**The #5707 divergence warning must skip external rows**, and that is not a hole. The warning exists to
catch *implicit* divergence — a caller that supplied a net and had it silently recomputed. Under `external`
the supplied net is not recomputed, so there is nothing to diverge from; the mode is the caller's explicit,
persisted assertion, which is strictly more information than the warning was built to recover. #5707's
`totalsFromStoredRow` flag answers an *origin* question and must not be overloaded to answer this
*authority* one — the same separation `lib/lineSnapshots.ts:33-38` already insists on, and § 2 restates.

**#5707 merged on 2026-09-08** (`5f3843eb7`), which settles the landing order an earlier revision of this
spec had to hedge. The warning now lives inside `buildBaseLineResult` at `lib/calculations.ts:143-163`,
gated on `line.totalsFromStoredRow !== true`, with a half-minor-unit
`NET_RECONCILIATION_TOLERANCE` (`:33`).

Nothing further is needed to suppress it: § 3's external branch returns at the **top** of
`buildBaseLineResult`, before `:143`, so an external line never reaches the reconciliation at all. The
suppression is structural rather than a second gate someone has to remember to add — and it is the reason
§ 3 specifies an early return rather than a late override.

**Quotes, invoices and credit memos** — see § 1.

## Alternatives Considered

| option | effect | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **A. Persisted mode columns on document and line** (this spec) | caller authority survives every sibling write; no behaviour change without opt-in; two defaulted columns | **chosen** |
| B. Honour a supplied `totalNetAmount` unconditionally (#5644 option 1) | no new column, no new field | rejected — freezes legacy rows the discount contract heals; explicitly not taken upstream |
| C. A per-request mode flag (on the input only, nothing persisted) | no migration at all | rejected — the next write to any sibling line recalculates the whole document and overwrites it. This is the Odoo `_inverse_tax_totals` failure, verbatim |
| D. Document-level mode only | one column instead of two | rejected — the line calculation is a pure function of one `SalesLineSnapshot` with no document in scope (`calculations.ts:118`), and `mapPersistedLine` is handed a line entity alone. The mode would have to be reached through a relation inside the mapper |
| E. Line-level mode only | one column instead of two | rejected — cannot express a header that legitimately differs from the sum of its lines, which is ~23% of orders in the measurement above and the harder half of the problem |
| F. Shadow columns retaining the caller's values through a switch back to `computed` | switching back is reversible | rejected — a second source of truth that nothing reads and nothing keeps correct; the caller's book of record already holds the originals (§ 8) |
| G. A separate "mirrored document" entity alongside `sales_orders` | perfect isolation | rejected — duplicates the whole document surface (lines, adjustments, returns, payments, shipments, UI, search, exports) to change how nine numeric columns are populated |

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Compatibility, stated as a criterion rather than a hope.** For every existing test and every caller
   that never sends `amountsMode`, output is byte-identical before and after: the same stored line
   amounts, the same header totals, the same response payloads. A migration that only adds defaulted
   columns and a code path gated on a value no existing row holds must be observably inert.
2. **Round trip.** Writing one line of an external order via `sales.orders.lines.upsert` leaves **every
   other line byte-identical** — including a line whose net differs from `unitPriceNet × quantity`, which
   is the case the property exists for.
3. **Header preservation.** After a create with a header net that differs from the sum of the supplied line
   nets, the persisted header is the supplied one, and it is still the supplied one after a sibling line
   write, a return create, and a return delete.
3a. **Header preservation survives the registries**, which criterion 3 alone does not prove. Two cases,
   both required: with core's provider totals calculator live — that is, with `commands/documents.ts`
   imported normally, so `providers/index.ts:5` has run — an external create persists the supplied header
   and not the line rollup; and with an additional test-registered totals calculator that returns a
   deliberately wrong header, the persisted header is *still* the supplied one. The second case is what
   distinguishes "we stopped our own hook" from "the supplied header is re-applied last", and only the
   latter is what § 4 claims. The same pair at line level for `registerSalesLineCalculator`.
4. **Markup.** A line with `totalNetAmount > unitPriceNet × quantity` round-trips exactly, and its derived
   `discount_amount` is negative. Covered explicitly, not incidentally — no clamp, at either the validator
   or the engine.
5. **Completeness is enforced.** `totalsMode: 'external'` without a `unitPriceNet`, net, gross or tax on
   some line, or without the header totals on the document, is a 4xx naming the missing field. Partial
   specification is not a mode. The `unitPriceNet` case needs its own test rather than riding along with
   the others: it is the one whose absence produces a *plausible* result instead of an obviously broken
   one — `discount_amount = −totalNetAmount`, which criterion 4 would read as a legitimate markup.
6. **No mixed documents, and both transitions are covered.** The § 1 invariant holds across
   `computed → external` and `external → computed` as well as at rest, and a request that sets
   `totalsMode` is evaluated as a transition rather than against the persisted mode (§ 6). An external
   order has no computed line, a computed
   order has no external line, in both directions, on create and on update.
7. **All twenty-three sites covered.** The twelve `documents.ts` writers, the `convert_to_order` copy, the
   six `restoreOrderGraph` undo sites, the three `returns.ts` writers, and the provider totals calculator
   each behave per its § 6 row. A change covering `documents.ts`'s `applyOrderTotals` call sites only would
   satisfy criteria 1–6 while leaving the return flows rewriting external headers — the defect the discount
   contract's D6 exists to prevent — and would still fail criteria 3a and 7a, because two of the groups are
   reached by importing a module and by restoring a snapshot rather than by being called.
7a. **Undo round-trips an external order.** Update an external order, undo the update, and both the amounts
   and both mode columns return to their pre-update values *together*. Separately: switch an external order
   to `computed`, undo that, and the order is external again with the caller's amounts — the case where
   dropping the columns from the snapshot leaves a document whose mode contradicts its own numbers.
8. **Payments are untouched.** Recording, updating and deleting a payment against an external order changes
   `paid`, `refunded` and `outstanding` and nothing else; `outstanding` derives from the caller's
   `grand_total_gross_amount`.
9. **Adjustments refuse** on an external order, with an i18n-routed error, and the document is unchanged
   afterwards.
10. **Returns record without rewriting.** Creating and deleting a return against an external order updates
    `returned_quantity` and the return document, and leaves the order header byte-identical to its
    pre-return values.
11. **Switch-back is explicit and complete.** Setting `computed` on an external order flips every line,
    recomputes header and lines, and is never triggered as a side effect of any other write.
12. **The #5707 warning does not fire for an external line** — asserted against the logger, not assumed
    from code reading, since the suppression is positional (§ Out of Scope). And `amountsMode` is never
    conflated with `totalsFromStoredRow`, `discountAmountFromStoredRow` or `discountAmountBasis` — no
    producer sets one to mean another (§ 2).
13. **No `any`, no hardcoded user-facing strings, no hardcoded status colours** in the UI of § 7.

## Testing Strategy

Unit — `packages/core/src/modules/sales/lib/__tests__/calculations.test.ts`:

- external line returns supplied net/gross/tax verbatim across a table of
  `(quantity, unitPriceNet, discountPercent, discountAmount, totalNetAmount)` cases, including ones where
  every derivation would produce a different answer;
- **an omitted `unitPriceNet` is rejected, not defaulted** — the case that otherwise derives
  `discountAmount = −totalNetAmount` and is indistinguishable from a markup (§ 4, criterion 5);
- the markup case, asserting the negative derived `discountAmount` and the absence of both clamps;
- the three § 8 switch-back cases, which have three different outcomes and only one of which is exact: a
  zero-percent discount line (net preserved), a markup line (net falls to `unitPriceNet × quantity`), and a
  line carrying a non-zero `discount_percent` (net re-derived from the percent);
- idempotency: `calculate(calculate(x)) === calculate(x)` for external lines, the same property the
  discount contract pinned for computed ones;
- a document whose supplied header differs from the sum of its supplied lines keeps the supplied header;
- `computed` behaviour unchanged — the existing suite passes untouched, which is criterion 1.

Unit — the registry stages, which is where criterion 3a lives and where the first draft of this spec was
wrong. Both need a *registered* calculator, not a mocked one:

- with a totals calculator registered via `registerSalesTotalsCalculator` that returns a deliberately wrong
  header, `calculateDocumentTotals` on an external document still returns the supplied header, and
  `outstandingAmount` is recomputed against the restored gross;
- the same for `registerSalesLineCalculator` and an external line;
- core's provider totals calculator (`lib/providers/totals.ts:183`) returns `current` unchanged for an
  external document and generates no provider adjustment, with a shipping and a payment method set — the
  case where it otherwise would.

Unit — `lib/__tests__/lineSnapshots.test.ts`: `mapPersistedLine` carries `amounts_mode` and sets no other
origin field; the § 2 separation invariant.

Command — `commands/__tests__/`: one case per § 6 row. Three groups need their own cases and are not
reachable from the ordinary `documents.ts` command tests:

- the three `returns.ts` sites;
- the six `restoreOrderGraph` undo sites — update an external order then undo it, and assert the amounts
  *and* both mode columns came back together (criterion 7a). A test that only checks the amounts passes
  today, because the amounts were never the part at risk;
- the completeness rejections, including the `unitPriceNet` one (criterion 5).

Integration — `packages/core/src/modules/sales/__integration__/`, self-contained per `.ai/qa/AGENTS.md`
(fixtures created in setup, cleaned up in teardown, no reliance on seeded data): create an external order
over `POST /api/sales/orders` with a header that disagrees with its lines, read it back over
`GET /api/sales/orders?id=…`, upsert one line, read back and assert every sibling is unchanged; then a
return create/delete cycle asserting the header is untouched; then the switch back to `computed`.

## Risks & Impact Review

| risk | severity | affected | mitigation | residual |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Core's own totals calculator rebuilds the header from the line rollup after the base result** (`lib/providers/totals.ts:191`, returning at `:370`), registered by a module side effect (`providers/index.ts:5`) that fires from both `sales/index.ts:2` and `data/validators.ts:6` | **high** | **every** external document, not a subset — this is the default path, not a deployment-specific one | § 4's two changes: the provider hook no-ops for external documents, and `calculateDocument` re-applies the supplied header after the whole registry (`:456-467`); § 6 lists it as the twenty-third site; criterion 3a pins it | none once both land. Missing only the first would leave a third-party calculator able to clobber; missing only the second would leave core's own hook doing it |
| A registered line calculator (`calculations.ts:375-378`) mutates an external line | medium | deployments with custom line calculators | § 3 re-applies the supplied line amounts after the registry, the same way § 4 does for the header; criterion 2 pins the round trip | a hook's work on an external line's amounts is silently discarded rather than silently applied — the safer direction, but still silent. § Decision Requested q3 asks whether skipping the registry outright would be more honest |
| A third-party totals calculator that deliberately moved an external document's header stops being able to | low | third-party modules | § 4 states the rule; the documented escape is to switch the document to `computed` first | a calculator written against a mode that does not exist yet cannot regress; the risk is only for code written after this ships |
| A return moves no header total on an external order, surprising an operator | **high** | any external-mode deployment that takes returns | § 6 states the rule; § 7's badge marks the document; criterion 10 pins it | intended, and the rule most likely to be overruled — see § Decision Requested q2 |
| A caller opts in with incomplete data and gets a 4xx it did not expect | medium | new integrations | § 4 completeness rule; criterion 5 requires the error to name the missing field | a stricter contract than the `computed` path, deliberately |
| Switching back to `computed` silently changes a legally filed total | medium | operators who use the switch | § 8 makes the loss explicit; § 7 requires a confirmation; criterion 11 forbids implicit switches | unrecoverable by design; the source system holds the originals |
| A third-party module or report reads `discount_amount` assuming non-negative | medium | third-party modules, custom reports | `UPGRADE_NOTES.md` entry; only occurs on rows a caller explicitly opted in | a report that sums the column across mixed rows understates the discount total |
| Two orthogonal mode-ish flags (`amountsMode`, `totalsFromStoredRow`) get conflated during implementation | medium | core | § 2's three-field table; criterion 12; the precedent comment at `lineSnapshots.ts:33-38` | the discount contract already lost a draft to exactly this conflation |
| The § 1 invariant is enforced in commands only, so a direct DB write can produce a mixed document | low | direct SQL, seeds | criterion 6 covers the command layer; the engine treats an unknown/absent mode as `computed`, so a mixed row degrades to today's behaviour rather than to nonsense | a direct writer can still create a document whose header and lines disagree — as it can today |
| Twenty-three guard sites, one missed | **medium** | core | § 6 enumerates all of them by `file:line`; criteria 7 and 7a name the returns flows, the engine-side hook and the undo path specifically | raised from low because the enumeration has now been found incomplete **twice** — the engine-side hook in one review, the undo path in the next — and both misses share one cause: the tables were built by grepping for `applyOrderTotals`, and neither of those sites calls it. A third site reached by some third mechanism is not hypothetical |

Contract-surface classification: see § Migration & Backward Compatibility.

## Final Compliance Report

- No cross-tenant exposure: every touched command already carries `{ tenantId, organizationId }` and every
  read stays inside the existing scoped `findWithDecryption` calls. The new columns are not scope-bearing.
- No direct cross-module ORM relations introduced; no new module dependency.
- Document math stays inside `salesCalculationService` (`packages/core/src/modules/sales/AGENTS.md`
  rule 1) — the mode is read inside the engine and no call site recomputes inline.
- No `any`; `SalesAmountsMode` is a union and the validators are `z.enum`, with types derived via
  `z.infer`.
- All new user-facing strings routed through locale files; error keys listed in § API Contracts.
- Two new columns → `yarn db:generate` produces one migration per affected module plus the
  `.snapshot-open-mercato.json` update; no `yarn db:migrate` is run as part of preparing the change.
- No generated registry changes, so no `yarn generate` run is required beyond the migration step.

## Decision Requested

Three questions need a maintainer answer before an implementation PR exists. Each changes what the code has
to do; none can be deferred to review.

| # | decision | if rejected |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Persisted columns at all** (§ Proposed Solution 1) — two defaulted `text` columns, no backfill | § Alternatives C, a request-only flag — which the Odoo precedent shows does not survive a sibling write, so rejecting 1 is effectively rejecting the feature |
| 2 | **A return on an external order records itself and leaves the header untouched** (§ 6) | refuse `sales.returns.create` / `sales.returns.delete` outright on an external order, and require the caller to mirror the credit document instead. Cleaner rule, blocks a real workflow |
| 3 | **Both registries still run on an external row, and the supplied amounts are re-applied afterwards** (§ 3, § 4) — the extension points stay live, but a hook cannot move a caller-asserted amount | suppress the registries for external rows outright, as commercetools does — *"Cart Discounts are deactivated for Line Items with this price mode"*. Same end state for the numbers; more honest, because a hook that cannot affect anything does not run at all, rather than running and having its output discarded. The cost is that a hook doing non-amount work on external rows (attaching an adjustment, writing metadata) stops running too |

Question 1 additionally has a scope sub-question worth answering explicitly rather than rediscovering at
implementation time: § 1 excludes quotes. If the maintainers would rather have symmetry now, it is one more
column pair and one more schema field, and the § 6 quote rows change from *unchanged* to mirrors of the
order rows.

On question 2 there is a third possibility this spec does not recommend but records: commercetools
*invalidates* rather than refusing — *"`taxedPrice` and `taxRate` are removed and must be set again"*. That
works for a cart, which is not yet an order and can sit un-orderable. An order that has already been placed
has no equivalent state, and a header total that is transiently absent on a legally filed document is worse
than either alternative above. Hence reject-or-preserve, not invalidate.

## Decision Record

*Empty pending maintainer sign-off. Record decisions here in the style of
[`2026-08-07-sales-line-discount-amount-contract.md`](2026-08-07-sales-line-discount-amount-contract.md)
§ Decision Record: one subsection per decision, stating what was decided, what follows from it for the
implementation, and what it leaves open.*

## Implementation Plan

Deliberately absent. As with the discount contract, no implementation plan exists until § Decision
Requested is answered — the three decisions change the shape of the change, not just its details.

## Changelog

### 2026-09-14

- **The document-level mode had two names.** The column, `CalculateDocumentOptions` and the `GET` response
  said `totalsMode`; the `POST`/`PUT` contract, the schema snippet, § 8 and criterion 5 said `amountsMode`,
  so a caller would have posted one name and read back another — the shape adjacent to the bug class this
  document exists to fix. Settled on one field per column: `totalsMode` on the document,
  `amountsMode` on a line, each returned under the name it is accepted under. § API Contracts now states
  that `totalsMode` cascades to every line — which is what makes § 1's invariant hold by construction and
  § 8's switch-back a single field on a single request — and that a line mode explicitly disagreeing with
  the document's is rejected rather than silently overridden.
- **§ 6's `sales.orders.update` row swallowed the § 8 switch-back.** A switch-back request carries neither
  lines nor totals, so the row told an implementer to leave the header untouched while § 8 and criterion 11
  require it to be rewritten — leaving a document with the caller's amounts and `computed` on both
  columns. § 6's preamble now says the rules are evaluated against the **persisted** mode, except for a
  request that sets `totalsMode`, which is a transition governed by § 8; the row carries the carve-out;
  and both transitions are tabulated, since only `external → computed` was previously described.
  Criterion 6 covers both directions.
- `lineItemCount` (`validators.ts:672`) is named as the tenth field of `orderTotalsSchema` and explicitly
  **not** caller-supplied — it is derived from `calculation.lines.length` (`commands/documents.ts:3678`).
  § 4 previously said "every field the schema accepts" and then listed nine.
- Two stale "seventeenth" ordinals for the engine-side site corrected to twenty-third. The historical
  changelog entry that says "seventeenth" is left alone — it was accurate when written.

### 2026-09-09

- § 6 gains the **undo path** as its own sub-table: `restoreOrderGraph` (`commands/documents.ts:4358`) →
  `applyOrderSnapshot` (`:3983`) assigns the header field by field at `:4039-4054` without touching
  `applyOrderTotals`, and is reached from six order-side handlers. Every order command already in the
  table had a second, unlisted header write behind it. The site count goes from seventeen to twenty-three,
  and § Data Models now requires `totalsMode`/`amountsMode` on `OrderGraphSnapshot` (`:329`) and
  `OrderLineSnapshot` (`:395`) — hand-maintained field lists that would otherwise drop the columns across
  an undo, leaving a document whose mode contradicts its own amounts. New criterion 7a covers it.
- § 4's completeness rule now requires **`unitPriceNet`**. § 3's derived `discountAmount` consumes it, but
  it is optional on the request (`data/validators.ts:337`) and `mapPersistedLine` coerces a missing one to
  zero (`lib/lineSnapshots.ts:30`), so an external line that omitted it derived
  `discountAmount = −totalNetAmount` — the line's whole net, shown as a discount, and indistinguishable
  from a legitimate markup under criterion 4.
- § 8's switch-back was **wrong about the direction** and is now three cases instead of one blanket claim.
  A markup line's net *falls* to `unitPriceNet × quantity`, it does not rise. A zero-percent discount line
  round-trips exactly, which is the reason § 3 derives the discount rather than storing zero. A line
  carrying a non-zero `discount_percent` re-derives from the percent — a latent trap worth naming.
- Six citations still carried pre-#5707 offsets and are corrected; the § Risks row on missed guard sites is
  raised to medium, since the enumeration has now been found incomplete twice and both misses had the same
  cause. `commands/payments.ts` outstanding is at `:316`, not `:317`.

### 2026-09-08 (later)

- Rebased onto `develop` @ `3076e5ccf` and re-verified the citations against it. #5707 merged in the
  meantime (`5f3843eb7`), moving `lib/calculations.ts` by 41 lines, `commands/documents.ts` by 12–14,
  `lib/types.ts` by 9 and `lib/lineSnapshots.ts` by 23, so the line numbers throughout were restated.
  (Six were missed and are corrected in the 2026-09-09 entry below; the "every line number" claim this
  entry originally made was too strong.)
- #5707 having landed settles what an earlier revision had to hedge as a landing-order dependency: the
  reconciliation warning now sits at `lib/calculations.ts:143-163` behind `totalsFromStoredRow`, and § 3's
  early return means an external line never reaches it. No second gate is needed, and § Out of Scope says
  so instead of describing two possible futures.
- § 2's orthogonal-signals table gains `totalsFromStoredRow` (`lib/types.ts:84`) as a fourth row. It is
  now the strongest argument in that section: faced with the same question, #5707 added its own origin
  field rather than reusing the discount's.

### 2026-09-08

- Added the totals-calculator stage as the seventeenth site in § 6. Core registers its own totals
  calculator by module side effect (`lib/providers/index.ts:5` → `lib/providers/totals.ts:183`); it
  rebuilds the header from the line rollup (`:191`) and returns it (`:370`), so honouring the supplied
  header in `buildBaseDocumentResult` alone would have been overwritten before anything persisted.
  § 4 now re-applies the supplied header after the whole registry, following the precedent
  `calculateDocument` already sets for paid/refunded (`calculations.ts:456-467`), and core's provider hook
  no-ops for external documents. § 3 gains the same re-application at line level, which also sharpens
  § Decision Requested question 3.
- Specified the channel the supplied header reaches the engine through: `totalsMode` and `suppliedTotals`
  on `CalculateDocumentOptions`. It had no channel before, which § 4 had left implicit.
- § API Contracts now widens `orderLineUpsertSchema` (`commands/documents.ts:6793`) and
  `orderLineDeleteSchema` (`:6797`) with an optional nested `orderTotals` group. Without it § 6's rule for
  the line commands was one no caller could satisfy.
- Added acceptance criterion 3a and the matching registry tests; updated criterion 7 and the § Risks table.

### 2026-09-07

- Initial proposal. Verified against `develop` @ `19bf96975`.
