# SPEC-ENT-007: Auth Login Interceptors as External Extension (MFA Challenge Gate)

## TLDR
Introduce MFA login gating as an **external extension** using existing UMES/API extension points, without modifying `packages/core`, `packages/ui`, or `packages/shared`.
The extension intercepts `POST /api/auth/login`, rewrites successful login responses to `mfa_required`, and swaps login UI to a challenge panel via component wrapper.
This spec is additive-only and includes explicit backward-compatibility and migration requirements.

## Overview
This specification extracts the auth-login interceptor behavior into a dedicated extension implementation path and contract. It is intentionally scoped to extension mode (app module / external package) to preserve platform upgradeability and avoid direct core modifications.

## Problem Statement
Current MFA onboarding relies on login response transformation and UI takeover. Without a formal extension-focused spec, implementation drifts toward ad-hoc platform edits, inconsistent contracts, and BC risk (especially around login response/cookie behavior).

We need a concrete spec that:
- Uses only extension surfaces
- Defines prerequisites and compatibility boundaries
- Defines response/cookie semantics for `mfa_required` branch
- Includes explicit integration coverage for auth login interception

## Proposed Solution
Build an extension module `auth_extensions` (app-level or standalone package) that provides:
1. API `after` interceptor for `auth/login`
2. Login-form component wrapper for `section:auth.login.form`
3. Event-driven UI handoff via `om:auth:login-response`
4. Strict fail-closed behavior (interceptor failures do not block standard login)

Scope choice for this spec: **external extension only**.
- Preferred location: `apps/mercato/src/modules/auth_extensions/`
- Optional packaged form: `packages/<vendor>/src/modules/auth_extensions/`

## Architecture
### Components
- `api/interceptors.ts` in extension module:
  - `targetRoute: 'auth/login'`
  - `methods: ['POST']`
  - `after(...)` rewrites successful response to MFA pending payload
- `widgets/components.ts` in extension module:
  - wrapper override for `section:auth.login.form`
  - listens to `om:auth:login-response`
  - renders MFA challenge panel when `mfa_required === true`

### Data Flow
1. User submits login form to `POST /api/auth/login`.
2. Auth endpoint returns standard success payload.
3. Extension interceptor checks MFA eligibility and rewrites response:
   - `{ ok: true, mfa_required: true, challenge_id, available_methods, token }`
4. Client emits/receives `om:auth:login-response` and wrapper displays challenge UI.
5. User verifies challenge on `/api/security/mfa/verify`.
6. Full session JWT/cookie is issued only after successful verification.

### Prerequisites (Must Exist)
- API dispatcher executes registered `after` interceptors for custom API routes, including `auth/login`.
- Login page exposes replacement handle `section:auth.login.form`.
- Login page dispatches DOM event `om:auth:login-response` with response detail.

If any prerequisite is absent, this extension spec is blocked until prerequisite spec is completed.

## Data Models
No new database tables in this spec.
Uses existing security entities from enterprise MFA module (`mfa_challenges`, `user_mfa_methods`, etc.).

## API Contracts
### Intercepted Endpoint
- `POST /api/auth/login` (existing)

### Success Branches
- Standard success (no MFA required):
  - existing response contract preserved
- MFA-required success (extension branch):
  - `ok: true`
  - `mfa_required: true`
  - `challenge_id: string`
  - `available_methods: Array<{ type: string; label: string; icon: string }>`
  - `token: string` (short-lived pending token)
  - `redirect` may be omitted or `null`

### Cookie Contract
- For MFA-required branch, auth cookie must represent pending state, not full-access state.
- If platform currently sets full `auth_token` before interception, dispatcher must support cookie overwrite aligned to rewritten token.
- This spec does not define new cookie names; it aligns existing `auth_token` semantics to pending-token branch.

## UI/UX
- Wrapper target: `section:auth.login.form`
- Event consumed: `om:auth:login-response`
- Challenge UI:
  - method list from `available_methods`
  - back action returns to login form
  - keyboard support for dialogs: `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter` submit, `Escape` cancel
- All buttons must use `Button`/`IconButton`
- API calls from UI must use `apiCall`/`apiCallOrThrow`

## Risks & Impact Review
### Incorrect cookie/session branch (High)
- Impact: user gets logged in without MFA challenge.
- Mitigation: add explicit integration assertions for response body + cookie value alignment.

### Interceptor not executed for custom routes (High)
- Impact: MFA branch never triggers.
- Mitigation: prerequisite gate + integration test proving interceptor execution for `auth/login`.

### Contract drift in feature/event IDs (Medium)
- Impact: ACL/subscriber mismatches.
- Mitigation: freeze canonical IDs in this spec and ENT-001 alignment patch.

### UI override unavailable in login tree (Medium)
- Impact: response rewritten but no challenge UI rendered.
- Mitigation: provider registration test in frontend route tree and wrapper smoke tests.

## Migration & Backward Compatibility
This section is mandatory for contract-surface changes.

### Affected Surfaces
- API route behavior (`POST /api/auth/login`) additive branch
- Component replacement handle usage (`section:auth.login.form`)
- DOM login response event (`om:auth:login-response`)

### Compatibility Rules
1. Do not remove or rename existing login endpoint.
2. Keep standard successful branch unchanged for non-MFA users.
3. MFA branch is additive and must be documented for clients.
4. Do not rename frozen handle/event IDs.
5. Any future event/field renames require deprecation bridge and release notes.

### Consumer Migration
- API consumers must handle `mfa_required: true` branch on login success.
- UI consumers may continue existing flow if they do not enable this extension module.

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1 — Extension Scaffolding
- Create `apps/mercato/src/modules/auth_extensions/`.
- Add `index.ts` metadata and optional `acl.ts`.
- Register module in `apps/mercato/src/modules.ts`.

### Phase 2 — Auth Login Interceptor
- Implement `api/interceptors.ts` with `security.auth.login.mfa-challenge` (or extension-specific id).
- Fail-closed behavior: return `{}` on errors.
- Add unit tests for rewrite/no-op/error branches.

### Phase 3 — Login Wrapper UI
- Implement `widgets/components.ts` wrapper for `section:auth.login.form`.
- Parse `om:auth:login-response` payload and render challenge panel.
- Add unit tests for payload parsing and wrapper state transitions.

### Phase 4 — Integration Verification
- Add end-to-end integration tests for:
  - login with MFA-enabled user
  - login with non-MFA user
  - invalid challenge and retry
  - cookie/token alignment in MFA branch

## Integration Test Coverage
### API Paths
- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `POST /api/security/mfa/verify`
- `POST /api/security/mfa/recovery` (if enabled)

### UI Paths
- `/login` standard flow
- `/login` MFA-required challenge flow

### Required Cases
1. Interceptor executes for `auth/login` and rewrites response.
2. Wrapper displays challenge panel on `mfa_required` payload.
3. Pending token does not grant backend access before verification.
4. After verify, full access is granted.

## Amendment 2026-08-21 — Central MFA-Pending Token Gate (issue #5212)

The interceptor's provisional token (`mfa_pending: true`, `mfa_verified: false`) was
accepted by every staff API because the canonical auth resolvers never inspected the
assurance claims. This amendment defines the gate that rejects pending credentials on every
path that resolves them — general staff APIs, RSC/page loads, and the session-refresh route —
except registered MFA completion routes.

### Contract

- `isMfaPendingJwtPayload(payload)` — `packages/shared/src/lib/auth/jwt.ts`. True iff
  `mfa_pending === true && mfa_verified !== true`.
- Pending-access allowlist — `packages/shared/src/lib/auth/mfaPendingAccess.ts`
  (generic infrastructure): `registerMfaPendingAccessRoutes(routes)` (additive, idempotent,
  methods merge per path), `isMfaPendingAccessAllowed(method, pathname)` (fail-closed:
  exact path + exact method, trailing-slash tolerant, case-insensitive), and
  `listMfaPendingAccessRoutes()` for tests/ops. The registry ships **empty**.
- Enforcement point — `resolveAuthFromRequestDetailed` / `resolveAuthFromCookiesDetailed`
  in `packages/shared/src/lib/auth/server.ts`: pending payloads resolve to
  `{ auth: null, status: 'invalid' }` unless the request matches a registered completion
  route; cookie/RSC resolution rejects pending tokens unconditionally.
- Alternate credential paths — the gate above only covers credentials that reach those two
  resolvers. `GET|POST /api/auth/session/refresh` is `requireAuth: false` and mints a staff JWT
  from the `session_token` cookie without consulting them, so two additional closures are part
  of this amendment:
  - `packages/core/src/modules/auth/api/login.ts` clears `session_token` whenever an interceptor
    replaces the issued token. A provisional login must not leave a remember-me cookie from an
    earlier, pre-enrollment login usable.
  - `packages/core/src/modules/auth/api/session/refresh.ts` refuses to mint (401 / redirect to
    `/login`, staff cookies cleared) when the caller presents an MFA-pending `auth_token` cookie
    or bearer token.
- Known residual — `AuthService.refreshFromSessionToken` itself remains MFA-unaware, and the
  SSO callback (`packages/enterprise/src/modules/sso/api/callback/oidc/route.ts`) plants
  `session_token` without passing through the login interceptor, so it never enters the pending
  state at all. Making session refresh aware of an unsatisfied enforced MFA policy is tracked
  separately and is out of scope for this amendment.

### Ownership boundary

- `packages/shared` owns only the generic registry and predicate. It contains no route
  defaults and no knowledge of any concrete MFA implementation.
- The enterprise `security` module owns the canonical `/api/security/mfa/{prepare,verify,recovery}`
  routes and registers them via `lib/mfaCompletionRoutes.ts`, imported by the module entry
  (`index.ts`) and by the completion routes' shared helper, so registration always precedes
  request authentication.
- Third-party MFA implementations register their own completion routes during their module
  bootstrap through the same additive API.

### Migration & Backward Compatibility

| Surface | Classification | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `registerMfaPendingAccessRoutes` / `isMfaPendingAccessAllowed` / `listMfaPendingAccessRoutes` / `isMfaPendingJwtPayload` | ADDITIVE-ONLY | New exports; signatures frozen as shipped here. Future evolution must keep existing call sites working or follow the deprecation protocol (§27). |
| Registry default set | CHANGED (security-narrowing) | Pre-amendment builds effectively allowed the provisional token everywhere; the fix intentionally narrows pending tokens to registered completion routes. No stable contract is removed — pending tokens were never documented as general credentials. |
| Login/MFA endpoint URLs, methods, request/response shapes | UNCHANGED | Completion endpoints keep requiring `auth.mfa_pending === true`; verified replacement tokens and non-MFA logins behave exactly as before. |
| `POST /api/auth/login` `Set-Cookie` behavior | CHANGED (security-narrowing) | When an interceptor replaces the issued token, the response now clears `session_token` instead of leaving a previously planted one in place. URL, method, request and response body shapes are unchanged. MFA accounts never had a usable remember-me cookie after verification (`issueVerifiedMfaToken` does not issue one), so no supported flow loses a capability. |
| `GET\|POST /api/auth/session/refresh` reachability | CHANGED (security-narrowing) | A caller presenting an MFA-pending `auth_token` now gets a redirect to `/login` (GET) or 401 (POST) with staff cookies cleared, instead of a freshly minted staff JWT. Response shapes for every other caller are unchanged. |
| `POST /api/auth/logout` reachability | CHANGED (security-narrowing) | The route is `requireAuth: true` and is deliberately **not** on the pending allowlist, so a pending token is rejected at the dispatcher before the handler runs. The browser still ends up logged out (the dispatcher clears the staff cookies), but the handler's session revocation and the `auth.logout` event do not fire, leaving an unrevoked `Session` row per abandoned challenge. Those rows are inert: the session's refresh token is dropped from the interceptor's replaced body and never set as a cookie, and the `sid` only appears in a pending token that is now rejected everywhere. Allowlisting `/api/auth/logout` was considered and rejected — it would widen the pending window for no security benefit. |
| Third-party MFA modules | MIGRATION REQUIRED (one line) | Any implementation that completes challenges on its own endpoints must call `registerMfaPendingAccessRoutes` during bootstrap; without it its completion routes reject pending tokens (fail-closed). |

| Path | Case | Suite |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/auth/login` → pending token issued | interceptor flow unchanged | `TC-SEC-002`, `TC-SEC-014` |
| `GET /api/auth/profile` with pending bearer/cookie | 401 + `auth_token`/`session_token` cleared | `TC-SEC-014` |

| `POST /api/security/mfa/prepare` / `verify` with pending token | reachable, contracts unchanged | `TC-SEC-014` |
| Verified replacement token | normal read + mutation access restored | `TC-SEC-014` |
| Failed-challenge cleanup / attempt exhaustion | correct code rejected after lockout; fresh challenge works | `TC-SEC-014`; TTL expiry at service level in `MfaVerificationService.test.ts` |
| `POST /api/auth/login` reaching the challenge | pre-enrollment remember-me `session_token` cleared by the challenge response | `TC-SEC-014`; unit: `api/__tests__/login.test.ts` |
| `GET /api/auth/session/refresh` replaying a planted `session_token` with a pending `auth_token` | no staff token minted; redirect to `/login`, cookies cleared | `TC-SEC-014`; unit: `api/__tests__/session.refresh.test.ts` |
| `GET\|POST /api/auth/session/refresh` after challenge completion | refreshes normally once the token is no longer pending | unit: `api/__tests__/session.refresh.test.ts` |
