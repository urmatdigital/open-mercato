# Skills Catalog

> All `om-*` skills organized by tier. Load this file when answering "what skill should I use?" or "what comes next?".
>
> Note: many pipeline skills (code review, auto-create/review PR, merge buddy, spec writing, changelog, …) are installed from the shared [open-mercato/skills](https://github.com/open-mercato/skills) collection into `.agents/skills/` by `yarn install-skills` — see the `external` block in `.ai/skills/tiers.json`. Skill names below stay valid regardless of source; the external collection also adds `om-auto-fix-issue`, `om-setup-agent-pipeline`, and `om-auto-fix-pr` (CI stabilization via `--ci-only`).

## Notes

- **preceded-by / followed-by** are suggestions, not hard constraints. The appropriate next step depends on context.
- Skills with `—` in preceded-by can be entry points for their workflow type.
- `om-smart-test` is usable at any stage and is not sequenced.
- `om-help` itself is always the entry point when the developer is disoriented.
