# Run — Implement Standalone Canonical Example Module (Milestone A + policy/schema foundations)

- **Branch:** `feat/implement-standalone-canonical-example`
- **Base:** `develop`
- **Started:** 2026-08-03
- **Status:** local implementation complete; provider-certified release lane pending
- **Resume with:** the provider-backed Milestone D lane recorded in [`2026-08-05-canonical-example-milestones-bcd.md`](2026-08-05-canonical-example-milestones-bcd.md#gap-completion-and-final-local-gate--2026-08-10-session-5).

## Scope Decision (user-directed, 2026-08-03)

The canonical spec is an umbrella contract whose §"Delivery Milestones and Merge Boundaries" explicitly
states it is **not** a requirement for one implementation PR and defines four independently-mergeable
milestones. Reconnaissance decomposed the umbrella into 27 steps, ~12 of them large.

**This PR delivers Milestone A (canonical delivery) plus the policy and schema foundations that every
later milestone depends on.** Everything else is recorded in "Deferred Backlog" below with its
dependency edge, so a follow-up run can pick it up without re-deriving the plan.

Second user-directed decision: `src/modules.ts` divergence between the monorepo app and the create-app
template is implemented with a **`TEMPLATE_CONTENT_TRANSFORMS` entry** (permitted — the spec forbids
transforms only under `modules/example/**`), keeping byte-level drift detection on the rest of the file.

## Reconnaissance Corrections to the Specs

The specs' own baselines were stale at `68b544764`. Verified facts:

| Spec claim | Verified state |
|---|---|
| "20 paths differ between the two example trees" | **0.** `diff -rq` is clean; reconciliation landed in `c2a1520a3`, keeping the monorepo side (redo handler + `ensureScope` in `commands/todos.ts`, string icon tokens in `backend/**/page.meta.ts`). |
| "136 files / 746,030 bytes; 104 / 555,327 emitted" | **137 files / 747,826 bytes; 104 / 552,409** excluding `__tests__` + `__integration__`. |
| PR #4277 "open, changes-requested, conflicting" | **Closed without merging.** Equivalent content landed separately as #4891 = `b2d26489c`, ancestor of HEAD. The design-foundation certification gate is now satisfiable. |
| PR #4301 baseline `bf25803d7a…` | Present, ancestor of HEAD. |
| PR #4883 baseline `092e56572c…` | SHA resolvable, but **PR #4883 is still OPEN/BLOCKED** — `packages/cli/src/lib/generators/module-override-targets.ts` does not exist on `develop`. The override-target fact family is upstream-blocked. |
| 8 pinned `main` baseline assets @ `f7c941570…` | Hashes **verified** correct. |

## Historical Deferred Backlog (completed later in this PR)

This table records the scope split made on 2026-08-03. The work was subsequently completed in the
Milestones B-D run linked above; it is retained as decision history, not as a current resume queue.

| Deferred work | Depends on | Why deferred |
|---|---|---|
| CANON-B gap slices: encryption, search, translations, `notifications.client.ts`, `data/extensions.ts`, `extension-points.ts` | Task 4 (inventory rows) | 6 independent vertical slices, each with its own integration test. |
| CANON-B: complete optimistic locking; shared Todo form extraction | Task 4 | `beforeList` at `api/todos/route.ts` drops columns; needs its own review. |
| CANON-B: cache + rich DI; setup seeding | Task 4 | Uses DI token `'cache'` (**not** `'cacheService'` as `packages/cache/AGENTS.md` claims — Boy-Scout fix needed). |
| CANON-B: DataTable bulk action + durable outbox + scheduler + CAS-leased worker + progress | Tasks 4, 6 | Largest single runtime slice: new entity + migration + 2 workers + 14-assertion integration test. |
| CANON-B: PR #4883 reader gaps (13 prerequisites) | **Upstream PR #4883 merge** | Changes `packages/cli` generators with monorepo-wide blast radius; `module-override-targets.ts` not on develop. |
| CANON-B: AI tools/agents, specialized registries, generator plugin, page middleware, portal broadcast | PR #4883 | Fact families depend on unmerged extractor work. |
| CANON-B: registry static-readability refactor (`injection-table.ts`, `components.ts`) | — | Behavior-preserving but pinned by existing env-gating tests. |
| CANON-B: reference-quality remediation batch (~49 items) | — | Splittable per-file; the security-critical one is Task 2. |
| CANON-C: `source-link-baseline.json` + 136 fence dispositions | Task 4 | Baseline assets must be read from `f7c941570…` via `git cat-file`; current versions have drifted. |
| CANON-C: `source-link-inventory.json` generator + validator | Task 4 | No markdown-link-validation infrastructure exists anywhere in the repo — greenfield. |
| CANON-C: local reference-fact generation (`portableSourceRoot` / `sourceKind: "local-reference"`) | PR #4883 | `toPortableSourceRoot` needs a new discriminant; 4 emission points. |
| CANON-C: skill/guide link migration (8 owner families) | Task 4 | One PR per owner family. |
| CANON-C: harness case additions | Task 9 | Dedup against OMH-027/035/181/185/193; count pinned in 6 places, writable ids in 5. |
| READ-P2 **remainder**: the "generated facts render exact-file source links only" half of Phase 1 step 2, the redaction fixtures, and the oracle families beyond the eight now covered | Task 9, Task 14 | The reason-gated fallback itself and its live channel landed in Task 14. |
| GOV-P1/P2: `knowledge-change.schema.json`, validator/controller, 9 mandatory workflow steps | CANON-C source-link-inventory | Validator consumes the inventory; needs a real knowledge-contract change to exercise. |
| SPEC-P2: 6 routing cases + 2 writable ordering proofs | Task 8, Task 9 | — |

## Findings From the Reference-Quality Audit (Task 4)

The inventory audit opened every file it was asked to mark `canonical`. **7 capability rows covering
9 files failed the bar** and carry `referenceStatus: "qa-only"` + `readStatus: "qa-only"` + a
`qaOnlyReason` naming the exact defect, so the harness cannot read them until they are remediated.

The most serious finding is a **second live tenant-isolation defect**, distinct from the one fixed in
Task 2 and not yet fixed:

> `apps/mercato/src/modules/example/api/todos/route.ts` — `beforeList` writes module-scoped
> `dynamicCfKeys` / `sortFieldMapRef` from tenant- and organization-scoped `CustomFieldDef` rows, and
> `transformItem` / `sortFieldMap` read them back on *later* requests. One tenant's custom-field key
> set therefore bleeds into another tenant's projection and sort map. `listFields` is also reassigned
> after `makeCrudRoute` already captured it, so that reassignment is dead code.

This is the file the canonical spec designates as the CRUD reference target. It is deliberately **not**
fixed in this PR: the fix changes request-scoped state handling in a route with live custom-field
behavior and needs its own review and regression coverage. It is tracked as the first row of the
deferred backlog. Until then `api.crud-factory` points at `api/customer-priorities/route.ts` — a fully
clean `makeCrudRoute` with scoped ORM binding, sort map, soft delete, and cross-module cache
invalidation — which the spec's "point to a safer exact file" allowance permits.

Remaining qa-only defects: `data/enrichers.ts` (`(context.em as any).fork()` erasing a deliberately
`unknown` type), `widgets/components.ts` (raw `amber`/`blue` palette shades instead of status tokens),
`cli.ts` (`em as any` on a data-mutating ORM handle), `api/organizations/route.ts` (`any` at response
shaping, raw `Response`, raw `console.error`), `api/assignees/route.ts` + `api/notifications/route.ts`
(raw `.json().catch(...)`), `subscribers/example-event.ts` (`any` in the exported handler signature).

## Corrections to the Reconnaissance Itself

- **`packages/create-app/template/src/modules/reference_module/` is NOT a repo artifact.** Recon reported
  it as a stray shadow-module skeleton copied into every scaffold. It is untracked local working-tree
  pollution: `git ls-tree -r origin/develop` has zero entries under that path, and git does not track
  empty directories. No fix was required and none is claimed. Anyone seeing it locally can simply delete it.

## Decisions Resolved Later in This PR

- `example_customers_sync` remains in both registries behind `some(id === 'example')`; it is inert in
  every fresh preset and activates only with the example module.
- `/blog/123` and the four `app.page.quickLinks.example*` keys remain, but `buildHomeQuickLinks()` now
  returns those links only when the example module is registered, so no fresh preset exposes dead links.
- The PR #4883 reader-gap work shipped inside this program and is covered by the final fact/topology
  and activated-extractor proofs.

## Initial Milestone A Validation — Superseded

This section records the first 2026-08-03 handoff. The final local gate and remaining external
release work are recorded in Session 8 below and in the Milestones B-D run linked at the top.

Runner: **local** (Docker unavailable in WSL).

Gate (`.ai/agentic.config.json` `validation.commands`), plus the canonical spec's sequence:

```bash
yarn template:sync
yarn build:packages
yarn generate
yarn build:packages
yarn i18n:check-sync
yarn i18n:check-usage
yarn workspace create-mercato-app test
yarn agents:check-budget
yarn typecheck
yarn test
yarn build:app
```

## Gate Results (2026-08-03, local runner)

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `yarn template:sync` | pass — app and template in sync |
| `yarn build:packages` | pass |
| `yarn generate` | pass |
| `yarn i18n:check-sync` | pass — 51 modules, all in sync |
| `yarn i18n:check-usage` | 21 missing keys — **all pre-existing**, in `design_system/gallery/entries/**` and `packages/ui/src/backend/schedule/ScheduleToolbar.tsx`; none of those files are in this branch's 42-file diff |
| `yarn workspace create-mercato-app test` | pass — 474 tests, 471 pass, 0 fail, 3 skipped |
| `node scripts/repo-wide-guards.mjs` | pass — 23 test files |
| `yarn agents:check-budget` | pass — no new overage; 4 chains now *smaller* than baseline |
| `yarn typecheck` | pass — 21/21 tasks |
| `yarn test` | 1 pre-existing failure: `apps/mercato/src/__tests__/storage-s3-routes.test.ts` (5 tests, `[Bootstrap] Modules not registered`). **Verified pre-existing** by checking out `origin/develop` and reproducing the identical 5 failures. Unrelated to this diff. |
| `yarn build:app` | pass |

Two environment issues surfaced mid-run and were fixed by `yarn install` + `yarn build:packages`, not
by code changes: a missing `typescript-standalone` dependency and a stale `packages/cli/dist` tree.
They accounted for the 11 create-app failures seen earlier.

**Not executed here:** `yarn test:create-app` and `yarn test:create-app:integration`. Both require
Verdaccio via Docker, which is unavailable in this WSL distro (`yarn registry:publish` fails before
reaching any new code). The activation fixtures they host were instead exercised against real
`mercato generate` output inside a staged standalone app, and the fixture engine runs on every
`yarn workspace create-mercato-app test`. The untested residue is the Verdaccio publish, the
`yarn install`, and the `yarn generate` shell wrapper.

## Historical Gaps from the Initial Milestone A Handoff — Closed

The initial handoff gaps are retained in the timestamped session entries below. They are no longer a
resume queue: the activated standalone controller now exercises the disabled and enabled module states;
case budgets were remeasured and ratcheted; the live fallback reason/capability channel is wired; the
broad installed-source glob is gone; all twelve read-policy families are covered; and the final runtime
matrix is 15/15. The only remaining release work is the trusted Linux/Bubblewrap provider lane followed
by hosted PR CI.

## Handoff Log

- **2026-08-03 — session 1:** Branched off `develop` at `68b544764`. Ran a 7-agent reconnaissance
  workflow over presets, template-sync, the example module, the harness, skills, and platform APIs;
  results in the Reconnaissance Corrections table above. Scope bounded by user to Milestone A +
  policy/schema foundations. `modules.ts` divergence mechanism chosen: `TEMPLATE_CONTENT_TRANSFORMS`.
  All 10 tasks completed and the gate run recorded above. PR
  [#4897](https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato/pull/4897) opened as a draft on the first commit
  and updated on every push. **Next session starts at the Deferred Backlog**, top row first (the
  `api/todos/route.ts` cross-request tenant bleed).
- **2026-08-03 — session 2 (`/om-auto-continue-pr 4897`):** Resumed from the Deferred Backlog. **Upstream PR #4883 merged** at 12:09Z, so `packages/cli/src/lib/generators/module-override-targets.ts` is now on `develop` and every backlog row that named it as a blocker is unblocked (none were implemented in this session). Three rows landed: the top-priority `api/todos/route.ts` cross-request tenant bleed (`c6cf75d34`), the reference-quality remediation batch (`7dea5f0cf`), and the read-policy broad-glob migration (`66998e1c7`). Decision recorded against the backlog's first row: `api.crud-factory` **stays** on `api/customer-priorities/route.ts` because the two capability rows demonstrate different CRUD mechanisms; only `api.crud-query-engine-custom-fields` flipped. Observed once in four full `yarn workspace create-mercato-app test` runs: `agent-harness-evaluator.test.ts` → "live Codex retries one successful startup that emitted no context reads" failed with `$.durationMs is below minimum 0`, a clock artifact in the fake-runner duration measurement; it did not reproduce in the other three runs and is independent of every change in this session. **Next session starts at the remaining Deferred Backlog rows**, in order: the CANON-B gap slices, the registry static-readability refactor (which is what still holds `umes.component-replacement` at `qa-only`), CANON-C source-link work (now unblocked), READ-P2, SPEC-P2, and GOV-P1/P2.
- **2026-08-03 — session 3 (`/om-auto-continue-pr 4897`):** Re-entered on `1bf4d162b`, merged `origin/develop` again (now `21fff9068`). Landed the READ-P2 live reason-code channel (`ce351d1aa`) and a guard fix for the previous session's CSV fixture route (`105288d42`) — `crud-indexer-config.test.ts` scans test fixtures too, and `repo-wide-guards` had been run *before* that fixture was added, which is how it was missed. **Lesson recorded: run `node scripts/repo-wide-guards.mjs` after the last test file is written, not before.** Create-app suite 483 tests / 480 pass / 0 fail; repo-wide guards green.

  **In flight at the time of writing:** user asked for multi-agent orchestration over the whole remaining backlog. Background workflow `wf_e7482555-423` (`canonical-example-backlog-recon`) is running 9 read-only planners — one per backlog row group — plus a conflict-aware sequencer. Script:
  `~/.claude/projects/.../workflows/scripts/canonical-example-backlog-recon-wf_e7482555-423.js`;
  transcript dir: `~/.claude/projects/.../subagents/workflows/wf_e7482555-423`.
  If this session dies before it returns, its per-agent results are recoverable from `journal.jsonl` in that transcript dir, or re-run it with `Workflow({scriptPath, resumeFromRunId: 'wf_e7482555-423'})` — completed agents return cached results. **Nothing in that workflow writes to the repo**, so an interrupted run leaves no partial state to clean up.

  **Known contended files** any parallel implementation must serialize on: `apps/mercato/src/modules/example/references/surface-inventory.json`, `.../surface-map.md`, `packages/create-app/agentic/shared/ai/harness/cases.json`, the byte-mirrored `packages/create-app/template/src/modules/example/**` tree, and the four specs' changelogs.

  **Next session starts** from the sequencer's wave 1 (or, without it, the Deferred Backlog top-down).

  **Incident (same session), worth not repeating:** `6936451c9` was committed with `git add -A`
  while the recon workflow's agents were reading the worktree. One planner had written probe
  artifacts despite its read-only brief — `packages/cli/src/lib/generators/__tests__/zz-probe.test.ts`
  (a scratch test dumping extension-surface facts to stdout) and an
  `export { readRootObject as __probeReadRootObject }` appended to
  `packages/cli/src/lib/generators/module-extension-facts.ts` — and both were swept into that
  commit and pushed. Reverted in `e211d2e3d`; `packages/cli/` now has a zero diff against
  `origin/develop`. **Rule: never `git add -A` while background agents are running — stage explicit
  paths, and diff `--name-only` against the base before committing.**

## Sequenced Wave Plan (from recon workflow `wf_e7482555-423`, 2026-08-03)

Nine parallel planners plus a conflict-aware sequencer decomposed the whole remaining backlog.
Full per-slice plans (files, tests, contract surfaces, conflict sets) are in that workflow's
`journal.jsonl`. Summary of the execution order:

| Wave | Parallel-safe | Slices |
|---|---|---|

**Hard sequencing findings:**

- **C1 must ship as ONE PR.** Two planners independently planned edits to
  `packages/cli/src/lib/generators/module-extension-facts.ts` with overlapping but *different*
  defect lists (propsTransform/staticObject/CallExpression/`Array.isArray` vs payload-collapse
  and unknown-framework-mode). Shipped separately each silently undoes half the other's fix.
  C1 is also a hard prerequisite for E3 and E6 — the extractor reads **zero** entries from both
  example registries today, so "made it statically readable" is unverifiable without it.
- **Two program-level cautions to state in every PR body:** (1) no generated artifact contains
  app-local example facts today (both `build.mjs` callers feed `extractAllModuleFacts` from
  `discoverPackageModuleSources` only), so until C3 lands a new example fact is provable only by
  a direct-extractor unit test; (2) zero of the 203 shipped cases declare `exampleRoots`, so new
  capability rows are inert for the live harness until wave 7 and must not be reported as harness
  coverage.
- **11 decisions need a maintainer** before their slices can start. They are listed in the
  workflow result; the biggest are entity-extension routing (E8), injection-table optionality (E3),
  the bulk-action widget shape (E7), the CANON-C baseline/inventory circular dependency, and the
  SPEC-P2 oracle carrier.

## Maintainer Decisions (2026-08-03, session 3)

Answered by the maintainer against the recon workflow's decision list. These are binding for the
remaining waves; a slice that contradicts one must re-open the decision rather than diverge.

| # | Decision | Chosen | Consequence |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Entity extensions (E8) | **Add optional `table?: string` to `EntityExtension`** and prefer it at `packages/shared/src/lib/query/engine.ts:926` | Ships as its own `packages/shared` PR with query-engine unit tests BEFORE the example's `data/extensions.ts`. ADDITIVE to a STABLE type. Fixes the naive-pluralizer bug (`example_customer_prioritys` vs `example_customer_priorities`) for every module, not just the example. Then `api/todos/route.ts` opts into `includeExtensions`. |
| D2 | Registry static-readability gate (E3) | **Always-on entries + pass-through wrappers** | Cross-module injection entries gated only by `metadata.requiredModules` (already enforced at `injection-loader.ts:466-471`); the two checkout component wrappers register unconditionally and return `Original` untouched when the flag is off, so rendered DOM and `TC-CHKT-031`'s `data-testid` hooks stay byte-identical. Retires `NEXT_PUBLIC_OM_EXAMPLE_INJECTION_WIDGETS_ENABLED` — **needs an explicit BC waiver + UPGRADE_NOTES.md entry**, and the env var must also be dropped from both `.env.example` files. Two permanently-registered inert overrides will be visible in the UMES DevTool; that is accepted. |
| D3 | DataTable bulk action shape (E7) | **Data-only `widget.ts` + `readApiResultOrThrow`; amend the spec** | Matches the existing `customer-priority-bulk-actions` precedent. No `packages/ui` contract change. The canonical spec's `widget.client.tsx` / `useGuardedMutation` wording is corrected to reality as part of E7. |
| D4 | CANON-C circular dependency | **Land a checked `source-link-topics.json` registry** | `topicId → declared owner + requirement class`, used as the baseline validator's resolution target. The inventory generator later asserts its derived topic set equals that registry exactly, so the registry stays a contract rather than a second authority. Unblocks C4 before C5. |

Still open (not asked, each has a recommended option recorded in the workflow result): the OMH-018/082/093/176
budget rebalance route (H4), the GOV-P1 standalone-command shape (H1), the SPEC-P2 oracle carrier (H2/H6),
`seedDefaults` content (E5), and the E7 scheduler/optimistic-lock sub-decisions.

  **In flight (session 3, after W0):** wave 2 implementation workflow `wf_701c1552-80e`
  (`canonical-example-wave-2`) — four slices in isolated worktrees, each committing to its own
  branch, each followed by an independent verifier that checks the branch's file list against the
  slice allowlist and re-runs the claimed tests:
  `wave2/c1-cli-reader-fixes`, `wave2/c2-exact-file-fact-links`, `wave2/f1-cache-di-docs`,
  `wave2/f2-read-policy-redaction`.
  Branches are **local to those worktrees and not pushed** — if this session dies before merging,
  the work is in `git worktree list` under `.claude/worktrees/` (or recoverable from the workflow's
  `journal.jsonl`, which records every commit SHA). Nothing has been merged into
  `feat/implement-standalone-canonical-example` yet, so the PR branch is unaffected by an
  interrupted run. Resume with `Workflow({scriptPath, resumeFromRunId: 'wf_701c1552-80e'})`.

  **Wave 2 merged (session 3).** All four slices landed; each was checked by an independent verifier
  before merge, and three came back `needs-work` with findings that were fixed on merge rather than
  waved through:

  - **C1** shipped an uncovered semantic change — the call-expression fallback was narrowed from
    "any call forwards its first argument" to "only identifier-callee calls do", and the whole
    1436-test CLI suite passed with the hunk reverted because the existing tests only exercise
    `ComponentReplacementHandles` calls, which an explicit formula intercepts first. Pinned in
    `a1c0f7d05` with a fail-before negative control. C1 also carries **two BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY §14
    notes for the PR body**: exactly one leaf changes across a real 55-module facts corpus
    (enterprise/security `section:auth.login.form` mode `replace`→`wrapper`), and modules naming a
    target via `ComponentReplacementHandles.section(...)` now publish `section:ui.detail.NotesSection`
    instead of the nonexistent `ui.detail` — a published-ID change for scaffolded apps.
  - **F2's headline claim was false as landed.** `exampleReadPolicySummary()` was never invoked by
    any test; one fixture validated a hand-built literal, another grepped source text. A real leak
    survived all 495 tests. Fixed in `0d9b84b16` by exporting the emission site's own composition as
    `sanitizedExampleReadPolicy(trace, root)` so there is exactly one project-and-sanitize path and
    it is the one under test. Mutation probe: dropping the sanitizer now fails two fixtures; before,
    it failed none.
  - **C1 defect 2 is NOT merged.** `extractInjectionTable` really does drop the string and
    single-object slot forms `ModuleInjectionTable` allows (measured: catalog 3, sales 3, wms 2,
    staff 1, integrations 1 — integrations contributes nothing today because of it — checkout 2).
    Landing the fix fails the `assertNoUnresolvedExtensionTargets` build guard on two stale core
    entries (`data-table:sales.payments:columns`, which no host declares and no DataTable renders;
    and `data-table:catalog.products:bulk-actions`, a redundant legacy alias). **New backlog row:
    remove those two stale entries, then land the slot normalization.**
  - Also observed: one agent left an uncommitted probe in ANOTHER agent's worktree mid-run. It was
    reverted by its owner and never reached a branch, but it is the second contamination incident
    this session — the per-slice allowlist + independent verifier is what caught both.

  **Gate after wave 2 (local runner):** `template:sync`, `build:packages`, `generate`,
  `i18n:check-sync`, `typecheck`, `build:app`, `repo-wide-guards` (24 files), `agents:check-budget`
  all green; `yarn workspace create-mercato-app test` 496/493 pass/0 fail; `@open-mercato/cli`
  1442/1442; `@open-mercato/core` 8992/8992; `@open-mercato/shared` 1724/1724. `yarn test` still has
  the one pre-existing `storage-s3-routes.test.ts` failure (5 tests), verified against a stashed tree
  in session 2.

  **Next session starts at wave 3** (E1 optimistic locking + shared Todo form; H1 GOV-P1), plus the
  new stale-injection-entry row that unblocks C1 defect 2.

  **In flight (session 3, after wave 2):** wave 3 workflow `wf_3141c54d-2b1` — three slices in
  isolated worktrees on branches `wave3/e1-todo-optimistic-locking`,
  `wave3/h1-gov-p1-knowledge-change`, `wave3/c1b-stale-injection-entries`, each followed by an
  independent verifier that now also runs its OWN mutation probe on every added test (added after
  wave 2 shipped a test whose headline claim was false). Branches are local to those worktrees and
  **not pushed**; nothing is merged into the PR branch until the verdicts are read, so an interrupted
  run leaves the PR branch untouched. Resume with
  `Workflow({scriptPath, resumeFromRunId: 'wf_3141c54d-2b1'})`; every commit SHA is in that run's
  `journal.jsonl`.

  **Wave 3 merged (session 3→4).** Three slices; **E1's verifier died mid-response**, so E1 was
  verified by hand instead of merged on trust — which is how its hole was found.

  - **E1 hole (found and closed).** Neutering the form's version threading (`updatedAt: null`
    instead of `item.updatedAt`), which fully disables optimistic locking on the edit surface, was
    caught by NOTHING: 76 app tests and 201 core optimistic-lock tests all stayed green. The
    API-projection test covers only the route; the workspace scan only greps for the presence of the
    helper primitives. Fixed by extracting the mapping as the pure `toTodoFormValues()` and pinning
    it in `components/__tests__/todo-form-values.test.ts` — that probe now fails 3 tests.
  - **Pre-existing classifier weakness (follow-up).** The scan's `COVERED_PRIMITIVE` regex counts a
    bare mention of `withScopedApiRequestHeaders` as coverage even with no version passed, unlike the
    tokenless `buildOptimisticLockHeader` case which it explicitly demotes. Fixing it means auditing
    every currently-"covered" file repo-wide. **New backlog row.**
  - **C1b was RED as delivered** — the generated-facts JSON budget guard failed at 3,506,266 against
    a 3,500,000 cap. Per maintainer guidance ("you can adjust the budgets in such cases"), raised to
    3,560,000 with a rationale comment matching the file's three previous raises; the ~28KB is the
    twelve recovered contributions. **This also resolves the H4 decision**: OMH-018's 3-byte slack is
    to be handled by raising `maxInitialContextBytes`, not by relocating prose.
  - **`sales.injection.payment-gateway-status-column` is now an UNBOUND registered widget.** Its
    binding could never resolve (PaymentsSection's DataTable has no tableId), so removing it broke
    nothing, but giving that table a real tableId so the column finally renders is a sales feature
    gap. Recorded in place. **New backlog row.**

  **Gate after wave 3 (local):** `template:sync`, `build:packages`, `generate`, `i18n:check-sync`,
  `typecheck`, `build:app`, `repo-wide-guards` (24 files), `agents:check-budget` green.
  create-mercato-app 515 (512 pass, 3 skipped) · core 8993 · shared 1724 · cli 1446 · ui 1758 ·
  cache 72. `yarn test` still carries only the pre-existing `storage-s3-routes.test.ts` failure
  (5 tests), re-verified against a stashed tree.

  **Next session starts at wave 4** (E2 translations/extension-points/notifications.client · H2
  SPEC-P2 evaluator plumbing · C3 local-reference fact emission), plus the two new backlog rows above.

  **In flight (session 4):** wave 4 workflow `wf_c230d9cf-a9b` — branches
  `wave4/e2-canon-b-small-gaps`, `wave4/h2-spec-p2-evaluator`, `wave4/c3-local-reference-facts`,
  each with an independent verifier that runs its own mutation probes plus a slice-specific check
  (C3: prove normal `module-facts.json` is byte-identical for package modules; H2: prove the new
  schema fields are inert for all 203 cases; E2: prove `yarn generate` really discovers the three
  new convention files). E1's inventory drift (`ui.form-create`/`ui.form-edit` need `TodoForm.tsx`)
  is folded into E2, which already owns the inventory. **SPEC-P2 oracle-carrier decision made:**
  the faithful option — `specRouting` in the response schema + `expectedSpecRouting` in the case
  schema + a `routing.spec-decision` validator — because the cheap label-based alternative cannot
  distinguish "wrong decision" from "wrong reason code".
  Branches are local and **not pushed**; nothing merges until verdicts are read. Resume with
  `Workflow({scriptPath, resumeFromRunId: 'wf_c230d9cf-a9b'})`.

  **Housekeeping:** `packages/shared/.tmp-dynamic-loader-*` dirs are leaked by
  `dynamicLoader.tsconfig.test.ts` and are NOT gitignored — sweep them before staging, or they get
  swept into a commit.

  **Wave 4 merged (session 4).** C3 clean; E2 and H2 came back `needs-work`.

  - **E2 shipped a FALSE CLAIM in a reference doc — the exact failure this program exists to
    eliminate.** The inventory and the file's own docstring said "Both hosts are bound to a live
    call site in this module." Run against the framework's own reader, the example emitted
    `unresolved: [example.todoForm, example.todosTable]` with reason `unbound-declaration`, while
    catalog/sales/auth emit zero. `hasDeclarationBinding` only counts a host as bound when the
    declared source REFERENCES `extensionPoints.hosts.<key>`; core modules import the declaration,
    the example duplicated the literal. Its own test **cemented** the defect by regex-matching that
    literal, so adopting house convention would have broken the test. Fixed on merge: both call
    sites now consume the declaration (`unresolved: []`), both tests pin the consumption pattern
    AND the extractor's own verdict, and all three doc claims were rewritten. Reverting a call site
    to a literal now fails 2 tests. A second test (`translations.test.ts`) matched the same literal
    and broke when it vanished — also repointed at the declaration.
  - **C3 is the unblocker and verified the strong way:** the verifier built the real facts corpus
    BOTH ways in one worktree, holding the 55-module corpus and the 1.05MB runtime registry constant
    and swapping only the two generator sources, and confirmed `module-facts.json` byte-identical by
    sha256. BC note: `ExtractAllModuleFactsResult` gained a REQUIRED `unresolvedFirstPartyTargets`
    — a return type, so readers are fine, but constructors/mocks break.
  - **H2 verified inertness three ways** (406 prompts across 203 cases x read-only/writable,
    compared base vs slice). Two notes for the wave that adds the six real cases: a read-only
    spec-routing case fingerprints a REAL `node_modules` twice per case (writable cases dodge it via
    a symlink short-circuit), and `.ai/harness/results` is fingerprinted on mtime/ctime so a
    mid-case touch there surfaces as a spurious read-only violation.
  - **Trap worth remembering:** 7 create-app tests failed after merging C3/H2 and reproduced with my
    own changes stashed — they were STALE BUILD ARTIFACTS, green after `yarn build:packages`. Always
    rebuild before diagnosing a create-app failure that mentions `build emits ...` or `published CLI bin`.

  **New follow-up:** the example's notification renderer is declared inline in
  `notifications.client.ts` rather than in `widgets/notifications/<Name>.tsx` as
  `packages/core/AGENTS.md` prescribes (the path was outside E2's allowlist). Docs tell readers to
  copy the structure, not the location. One-file move plus import.

  **Gate after wave 4 (local):** template:sync, build:packages, generate, i18n:check-sync, typecheck,
  build:app, repo-wide-guards (24), agents:check-budget all green. create-mercato-app 527 (524 pass,
  3 skipped) · app example 94/94. `yarn test` carries only the pre-existing
  `storage-s3-routes.test.ts` failure (5 tests).

  **Next session starts at wave 5** (E3 registry static-readability — note maintainer decision D2
  requires a BC waiver + UPGRADE_NOTES.md entry for retiring
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_OM_EXAMPLE_INJECTION_WIDGETS_ENABLED`; H3 the six SPEC-P2 routing cases OMH-214..209).

  **Concurrent push by another actor (session 4).** While wave 4 was merging, someone pushed
  `c2264fe51 Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/develop' into review/pr-4897`, bringing 13 develop
  commits onto the PR branch. My push was correctly rejected; merged rather than force-pushed, so
  their work is intact. **Consequence worth celebrating: `ab1620a63` (#4926/#4931, mock i18n in the
  app-level storage_s3 route suite) FIXES the `storage-s3-routes.test.ts` failure this program has
  carried as pre-existing since session 1. `yarn test` now exits 0 — the gate is fully green for the
  first time.** Do not keep quoting that failure as a known-bad in future PR bodies.

  **Conflict resolved (session 4).** After the concurrent push, `develop` advanced again and the PR
  went `DIRTY`. One real conflict: `scripts/repo-wide-guards.mjs`, where both sides appended a
  different entry to the same append-only exemption list — resolved by keeping BOTH
  (`template-example-module-parity.test.ts` from this branch, `standalone-portal-email-env-guard.test.ts`
  from develop). `package.json.template` auto-merged. PR is `MERGEABLE` again at `8ddeba7ba`;
  full gate re-run green (`yarn test` exit 0, create-mercato-app 536/533 pass).
  **This list is a known recurring conflict point** — expect it whenever two branches add a guard.

  **In flight:** wave 5 workflow `wf_30380b88-690` — `wave5/e3-registry-static-readability` and
  `wave5/h3-spec-p2-routing-cases`. E3 carries maintainer decision D2 and therefore drafts an
  `UPGRADE_NOTES.md` entry + removes `NEXT_PUBLIC_OM_EXAMPLE_INJECTION_WIDGETS_ENABLED` from both
  `.env.example` files — **that wording needs maintainer review before merge**. H3 must update the
  case count in 6 documents + 2 hard-coded literals and the writable-id order in 5 places.
  Verifiers now also mechanically re-check every factual claim in any doc the slice touched, after
  wave 4 shipped a provably false one. Resume: `Workflow({scriptPath, resumeFromRunId: 'wf_30380b88-690'})`.

## Injection-flag safety audit (maintainer-raised, session 4) — BINDING ON E3

The maintainer flagged that the injection-widget flags could impact integration tests. Audited
before merging E3; findings change what E3 is allowed to do.

**Two DIFFERENT flags, with opposite risk profiles. Do not conflate them.**

| Flag | Who sets it | Effect of "always-on" | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_OM_EXAMPLE_INJECTION_WIDGETS_ENABLED` (injection table) | `packages/cli/src/lib/testing/integration.ts` sets `'true'` at **two** call sites (:1989, :3341); `.github/workflows/snapshot.yml:249` and `npm-snapshot-preview.yml:331` set it too | Integration tests **already run with it on**, so making entries unconditional is a **no-op for every integration spec** (incl. `TC-UMES-004`, `todo-priority-validation`) | **SAFE** |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_OM_EXAMPLE_CHECKOUT_TEST_INJECTIONS_ENABLED` (component wrappers) | Defaults **false** in both `.env.example`s; the harness does **NOT** set it | `TC-CHKT-031-wrappers.spec.ts:13` **skip-gates on it** and asserts `example-checkout-summary-wrapper` / `example-checkout-help-wrapper` testids are visible | **MUST SURVIVE** |

**Binding consequences for E3:**

1. The checkout flag is **NOT** retired. D2's pass-through design is only correct if the flag check
   moves INSIDE each wrapper and the wrapper still renders its `data-testid` div when the flag is
   `true` — otherwise TC-CHKT-031 fails the moment anyone runs it with the flag on. Verify by
   running that spec's DOM assertions, not by reasoning about them.
2. **Do NOT delete `NEXT_PUBLIC_OM_EXAMPLE_INJECTION_WIDGETS_ENABLED` from the `.env.example` files
   or CI.** Per the maintainer's "make it safe or keep it just a side note": deleting it makes four
   live references (2 harness call sites, 2 CI workflows) dead, for no functional gain — the static
   readability E3 actually needs comes from the unconditional export, not from removing the var.
   Deprecate in place instead: leave it defined, documented as a no-op with a pointer to
   `metadata.requiredModules`, and skip the `UPGRADE_NOTES.md` removal entry. **If E3 deleted it,
   revert that part on merge and keep the rest.**

  **Wave 5 merged (session 4).** Both slices landed; the injection-flag audit was applied at merge.

  - **E3 achieved its actual purpose, measured:** the real extractor read **0** injection-table and
    **0** component-override contributions from the example before, **26 and 3** after — and the
    verifier reproduced the 0/0 baseline on a fresh detached worktree instead of taking it on trust.
    Root cause confirmed by reading the code: `staticValue` folds a ConditionalExpression only when
    both branches are deeply equal, and neither registry qualified.
  - **The checkout flag survived**, moved inside each wrapper, as the safety audit required.
    `TC-CHKT-031-wrappers` skip-gates on it while asserting the wrapper testids. The pass-through is
    asserted by React component identity + `renderToStaticMarkup` byte-equality, not by grepping source.
  - **E3's agent caught a false premise in maintainer decision D2.** D2 said cross-module entries
    would be "gated only by `metadata.requiredModules`" — no example widget declares that field. The
    agent verified and REFUSED to write the claim, documenting the gating that actually holds.
    **Follow-up:** add `requiredModules` to the widgets that call other modules' APIs
    (`catalog-seo-report` → `['catalog']`, the customer-priority widgets → `['customers']`).
  - **Completed at merge what E3 could not reach:** four dead env exports (integration harness x2,
    CI workflows x2) and `apps/docs/.../widget-injection.md`, which after E3 documented a live toggle
    that no longer existed — a new false doc claim, caught before it shipped. Plus the UPGRADE_NOTES
    sentence stating the real default change for scaffolded apps.
  - **H3 shipped 5 of 6 rows. Row 6 (reuse-spec) is structurally blocked**, not omitted: the validator
    requires `coveringSpecPath` to name a file that exists in the staged app, a fresh scaffold ships
    only a README and a blank template under `.ai/specs/`, and `validateCatalog` forbids fixtures on
    non-writable cases. **Unblocks when the writable existing-spec proof (wave 8, H6) lands** — it
    seeds its own covering spec. Alternative: ship a real example spec in every scaffold (product
    decision).
  - H3 edited `cases.schema.json` and `validators.json` outside its allowlist — mechanically
    unavoidable (schema pinned `maxItems: 203` and id pattern `20[0-3]`); merged cleanly with H2's
    edits to the same files.

  **Gate after wave 5: FULLY GREEN.** `yarn test` exit 0, create-mercato-app 537 (534 pass, 3
  skipped), all guards, budget, build:app.

  **Next: wave 6** — E4 (encryption + search) and H4 (CANON-C link migration; OMH-018 budget bump is
  approved per the maintainer's budget guidance).

  **In flight (session 4):** wave 6 workflow `wf_8b7a6a12-7d7` — `wave6/e4-encryption-and-search`
  and `wave6/h4-canon-c-link-migration`. E4 is the first slice in this program to touch the DATABASE
  (a nullable encrypted column on `todos` + migration + snapshot), so its verifier has an extra
  blocker-level check: inspect the generated SQL and snapshot diff for unrelated churn, confirm
  `findWithDecryption` is used instead of raw `em.find`, and confirm the encrypted column does not
  break search/sort/CSV (an `$ilike` over ciphertext matches nothing). H4 raises
  `maxInitialContextBytes` per the maintainer's budget guidance rather than relocating prose, and is
  restricted to budget VALUES in `cases.json` — it must not add or remove cases (H3 owns the case set).
  Branches local, not pushed. Resume: `Workflow({scriptPath, resumeFromRunId: 'wf_8b7a6a12-7d7'})`.

  **Wave 6, part 1 (session 4).** H4 merged; **E4's implementer died mid-response and produced ZERO
  commits**, so it was relaunched as `wf_acf7085b-c56` on branch
  `wave6/e4-encryption-and-search-retry` with an explicit instruction to **commit incrementally** —
  the first attempt lost ~2.4h of work to one dropped connection. That instruction is worth keeping
  in every future long slice.

  - **H4's verification was the strongest in this program so far:** rather than trusting the unit
    test, the verifier **scaffolded three real apps** (classic, empty, crm) with full agentic setup
    and resolved all 102 relative links across all 93 emitted Markdown owners against each generated
    root — 0 dead, 0 directory targets. One probe pointed at a file that EXISTS in the repo but that
    `SKIP_DIRS` never copies into a generated app, proving the check tests emitted-app reality rather
    than repo existence.
  - **H4's own negative control caught a self-inflicted bug**: a first/last-occurrence restore had
    silently moved OMH-018's budget raise onto a DIFFERENT case. The full suite caught it; eyeballing
    the diff would not have. Worth remembering when scripting edits across a large JSON catalog.
  - **Two honest findings from H4 carried forward:** (1) the canonical spec says "the eight owner
    families" while its table has NINE data rows — used the table as written, discrepancy recorded in
    the spec changelog rather than silently renumbered; (2) **MEDIUM, pre-existing and disclosed:**
    the initial-context budget arithmetic is computed against REPO AUTHORING SOURCES, not the emitted
    app tree, and the two differ — so every budget number in the harness is a close proxy rather than
    an exact measure. Deepened by this slice, not introduced. **New backlog row.**
  - **CANON-C is NOT complete.** H4 migrated 5 owner families fully, 2 partially (their installed-
    package targets need a packed artifact to prove resolution, which no gate in that slice provides),
    and 2 not at all — the root-instruction pair (`AGENTS.md.template` and `template/AGENTS.md` are
    byte-identical apart from the H1 and must move together; the second was outside the allowlist) and
    the optional Figma owner, **which the slice verified does not exist as an emitted owner at all**
    rather than repeating the spec's assumption. `source-link-inventory.json` /
    `source-link-baseline.json` and the 136-fence ledger remain outstanding.

  **Wave 6 complete (session 4).** E4 was relaunched after its first implementer died with zero
  commits; the retry was told to **commit incrementally** and produced 4 commits — keep that
  instruction in every long slice.

  - **E4's migration passed the sanity gate cleanly**, which mattered: 13 lines, one statement per
    direction, nullable, reversible, and the snapshot diff a single 16-line hunk. The verifier parsed
    the snapshot and confirmed only this module's three tables. **Pre-existing problem it exposed:**
    `yarn db:generate` emits a spurious `packages/core/src/modules/wms` migration + snapshot rewrite
    on EVERY run on a clean tree. The slice deleted that output each time under the coding-agent
    exception. **New backlog row — it makes the migration gate noisy for everyone.**
  - **REWORKED ON MERGE — E4 reinvented a platform capability.** It added a bespoke `notesSearch`
    param resolving ids via `findEntityIdsBySearchTokens`, on the premise that an `$ilike` over
    ciphertext matches nothing. That is only true of RAW SQL: `engine.ts` → `applyFilterOp`
    intercepts like/ilike and rewrites it into a `search_tokens` lookup when the column is encrypted
    and search is active, with `applySearchTokens` applying tenant/org scope itself. Verified
    directly. The hand-rolled path duplicated platform behaviour AND re-derived a scope the platform
    already applies — in the module whose job is to teach the right pattern. It was also strictly
    MORE fail-closed (returning zero rows on `matched: false`, the exact failure it set out to
    avoid, relocated), contradicting the documented MUST NOT in `tokenLookup.ts`. `notes` is now a
    plain `$ilike`; ~30 lines and an exported helper removed.
  - **Another backwards doc claim corrected:** the route said an encrypted column "is not a sortable
    column" because `notes` is absent from `sortFieldMap`. Omitting it blocks NOTHING — the factory
    falls through to the raw field name, so `?sortField=notes` reaches the engine and takes a correct
    but row-capped decrypt-then-sort-in-memory path. Blocking it needs an explicit allowlist.
  - **The `durationMs` flake is fixed at the root**, not re-run away: `Date.now() - started` goes
    negative on an NTP step, failing the result schema's `minimum: 0`. Now `performance.now()` with a
    floor. Seen twice in this program on different live-runner tests, each time unreproducible, each
    time costing a diagnosis.
  - **Still open from E4's verifier** (recorded, not fixed): 9 of 26 of its probes MISSED — the whole
    notes-search block could be disabled or stripped of tenant/org scoping with every example test
    green (not exploitable, since the engine re-applies scope, but asserted-correct with no guard);
    no integration test for a slice adding an API param, a response field and a form field; two raw
    `em.find(Todo, …)` reads remain in `data/enrichers.ts` on an entity that now carries an encrypted
    column; and three installed-harness docs now assert falsehoods ("No canonical encryption map
    exists yet", "the example ships no search.ts") that belong to a harness-refresh slice.

  **Gate after wave 6: FULLY GREEN.** `yarn test` exit 0 (25/25 turbo tasks), create-mercato-app 540
  (537 pass, 3 skipped) across three consecutive runs, all guards, typecheck, build:app.

  **Next: wave 7** — E5 (cache + rich DI + setup seeding) · H5 (CANON-C harness case additions) ·
  C4 (source-link baseline, using the checked `source-link-topics.json` registry per decision D4).

  **In flight (session 4):** wave 7 workflow `wf_d1439c4d-882` — `wave7/e5-cache-di-seeding`,
  `wave7/h5-harness-example-roots`, `wave7/c4-source-link-baseline`.

  - **H5 is the one that matters most for this whole program's honesty.** Zero of the 208 shipped
    cases declare `context.exampleRoots`, so every capability row added so far is INERT for the live
    harness — the read-policy machinery is fully built and fixture-covered but has never been
    exercised by a real case. H5 also has to REWRITE (not delete) the compatibility tests that
    currently assert "no shipped case declares the new fields", which become false the moment it
    lands.
  - **E5 carries an unresolved design question deliberately left open**: what `seedDefaults` actually
    seeds. Option B (no schema change) is the default; Option A revives the dead `ExampleItem` with a
    migration. The agent was told to settle it from the spec's wording and to say plainly if Option B
    produces a hollow demonstration, rather than assume.
  - **C4** implements decision D4 (a checked `source-link-topics.json` registry) to break CANON-C's
    circular dependency, and was told to VERIFY the recon's claims about the 8 pinned assets and 136
    fences rather than build on them — several recon claims have already proven stale.

  Branches local, not pushed. Resume: `Workflow({scriptPath, resumeFromRunId: 'wf_d1439c4d-882'})`.

  **Wave 7 merged (session 4). The milestone here is H5.** Until it landed, ZERO of the 208 shipped
  cases declared `context.exampleRoots` — so every capability row six waves of work had added to the
  example was **inert for the live harness**. OMH-219..212 now declare it across four disjoint
  capability groups. 212 cases, contiguous. The verifier enumerated all **14** count/order pins from
  scratch and confirmed none was missed.

  - **E5 corrected two false premises in its own brief**, and both corrections improved the result.
    (1) The brief framed seeding as `onTenantCreated` vs `seedDefaults`; `ModuleSetupConfig` declares
    a THIRD hook, `seedExamples`, which the spec requires by name — the hooks now differ by
    capability, not by a passed argument. (2) The brief claimed `Todo` is the only tenant-scoped
    store, so scoped defaults needed the dead `ExampleItem` revived with a migration. `ce.ts` already
    declares `example:calendar_entity`, a virtual custom entity in `custom_entities_storage` WITH
    tenant/org columns — which removed Option A's entire motivation, so E5 shipped with **no schema
    change**. Writing briefs from recon summaries is now demonstrably riskier than letting the agent
    check; keep telling them to verify the brief.
  - **E5's own negative control caught a hollow test**: breaking `recordId` left the idempotency
    assertion green because it compared `[undefined, undefined, undefined]` to itself.
  - **Closed on merge, H5's one MISSED probe**: appending a capability to a case's
    `allowedCapabilityIds` silently widened its example-read scope with the whole suite green,
    because the reachability test derived its expected allowlist FROM the case's own declaration —
    widening both sides equally. Per-case capability sets are now pinned; re-running that probe fails.
  - **Closed on merge, C4's emission asymmetry**: the slice put both JSON ledgers and the validator
    under `agentic/shared/**`, which the scaffolder copies wholesale into every generated app. They
    are monorepo-only (the baseline pins monorepo SHAs and validates monorepo files), so that shipped
    ~148KB of dead weight per scaffold. Moved to `packages/create-app/scripts/`, outside the copied
    tree. **Rule worth remembering: anything under `agentic/shared/{ai,scripts}` SHIPS.**
  - C4 verified both recon claims rather than assuming: the 8 assets really are read from SHA
    `f7c941570` via `git cat-file` (all 8 working-tree files have drifted), and the validator reports
    **8 assets, 136/136 dispositions, 125 topics**.
  - **Also addressed, and NOT an E5 defect:** `integrationTestPaths` holds both unit and integration
    evidence by design, but the name reads as a promise of integration coverage — a verifier made
    exactly that misreading and called it blocking. **20 rows predating E5 use the same convention.**
    The inventory note now states the distinction outright and `inventory-evidence-honesty.test.ts`
    pins it, including that every evidence path must resolve on disk.

  **Gate after wave 7: FULLY GREEN.** `yarn test` exit 0 (25/25 tasks), create-mercato-app 546 (543
  pass, 3 skipped), guards, budget, build:app.

  **Next: wave 8** — E6 (remaining fact families: ai-tools, ai-agents, generators, page middleware,
  portal broadcast) · H6 (SPEC-P2's two writable ordering proofs — **this unblocks H3's row 6**,
  the `reuse-spec` case, because the writable proof seeds its own covering spec).

  **In flight (session 4):** wave 8 workflow `wf_22176c0b-7a4` — `wave8/e6-remaining-fact-families`
  and `wave8/h6-spec-p2-writable-proofs`.

  - **H6 unblocks H3's row 6.** The `reuse-spec` case was structurally impossible because the
    validator needs `coveringSpecPath` to name a file existing in the staged app, a fresh scaffold
    ships only a README and a blank template under `.ai/specs/`, and `validateCatalog` forbids
    fixtures on non-writable cases. The existing-spec WRITABLE proof seeds its own covering spec, so
    once it exists the read-only case becomes expressible. H6 was told to add it and state plainly
    whether it is genuinely covered afterwards.
  - **H6 also carries a real design fork the recon flagged**: `evaluate-agent-harness.mjs` (~line
    941) requires every semantic oracle to list `writable-ast-oracles.mjs` as a runner, and a
    MARKDOWN-grading spec oracle does not fit an AST oracle. Either embed it there (impure) or relax
    the guard (weakens a deliberate check). The agent must pick, justify, and NOT quietly work
    around the guard — the verifier is asked to judge exactly that.
  - **E6** was told to run the real extractor before and after and report the delta per fact family,
    because a family still reporting zero contributions is not done regardless of what shipped — and
    to refuse to invent a fake consumer just to pad a fact count.
  - Verifiers now also hunt **self-referential assertions** specifically, after two appeared in this
    program (one deriving its expectation from the declaration it constrained, one comparing
    `undefined` to itself).

  Branches local, not pushed. Resume: `Workflow({scriptPath, resumeFromRunId: 'wf_22176c0b-7a4'})`.

  **Wave 8 merged (session 4).** Both slices came back `needs-work` with real findings, and E6
  surfaced a defect **wave 7 introduced and I merged**.

  - **MY RUN-DOC PREMISE WAS WRONG (third time this program).** I recorded that H6 would unblock
    H3's `reuse-spec` row 6. It does NOT. The implementer reproduced the blocker and the verifier
    re-confirmed it in source: the evaluator forbids `expectedSpecRouting` on a writable case,
    requires `coveringSpecPath` to appear in the case's own context, and requires every declared
    context path to EXIST in the fresh-scaffold root the deterministic lane validates. OMH-224's
    covering spec lives only in a fixture-prepared disposable copy, and read-only cases may not
    declare fixtures. **Row 6 remains blocked; it was not faked.** Unblocking it needs either a real
    example spec shipped in every scaffold (product decision) or an evaluator change.
  - **The oracle-runner fork was resolved honestly**: the guard was generalized to bind each oracle
    to its declared runner and TIGHTENED in both directions, not relaxed. Verifier confirmed.
  - **H6's 3 allowlist deviations were each PROVEN justified** — the verifier reverted each single
    number individually and watched an allowlisted guard go red. It also enumerated **20** count pins
    where the brief said 14, and found one stale: `AGENT-HARNESS.md:23` still said "46 such cases",
    and the spec changelog wrongly claimed that file had been resynchronized. Both fixed on merge.
    **That file is not covered by the count guard and rots silently — check it by hand every time.**
  - **E6: two VACUOUS tests fixed on merge.** (1) "never accepts tenant or organization as tool
    input" fed only scope keys to `safeParse`; for the one tool with a required field the parse
    fails, the fallback empties the object, and all four assertions became
    `expect(undefined).toBeUndefined()` — leaving the pack's headline safety property unpinned for
    the only tool it could matter for. Now asserts the DECLARED schema shape plus a smuggled-key
    case. (2) "stays silent when the write is unscoped" asserted only that the handler resolves; it
    always returns void and swallows emit failures, so it held whether or not it broadcast — a probe
    showed it publishing with empty tenant/org onto the global bus with all 14 tests green. Now
    installs a fake bus and asserts emit was NOT called.
  - **E6 also corrected a false doc claim in 3 places**: the agent's `systemPrompt` is NOT
    "compiled from named PromptTemplate sections … so the override system can address a section by
    name". `AiAgentDefinition.systemPrompt` is a plain string and the override path wraps it as a
    single `role` section.
  - **`di-registration` was a SILENT ZERO introduced in wave 7** (`00cba7f17`). `getPropertyName`
    returned undefined for a computed key, so `{ [SERVICE_TOKEN]: asFunction(...) }` produced no fact
    AND no diagnostic — the unresolved-token path only fires for a NAMED token. The example claimed
    `module.di-registration` while scoring zero. Fixed in the READER, not the example: a computed key
    is the better pattern. Repo-wide, 34 package modules now emit 143 di-registration facts.
  - **Still open — a SECOND silent-zero family:** `search` reports 0 facts although the module ships
    `search.ts` and the inventory claims `search.module-config`. Same class of root cause. **New
    backlog row.** Also still 0: `generator-plugin` (needs a convention file + consumer, outside E6's
    allowlist), `worker`, `vector`.

  **Gate after wave 8: FULLY GREEN.** `yarn test` exit 0 (25/25 tasks), create-mercato-app 577 pass,
  cli 1522, guards, budget, build:app.

  **Next: wave 9** — E7 (the DataTable bulk action + durable outbox + scheduler + CAS-leased worker
  + progress slice, the largest single runtime slice) · H7 (GOV-P2 controller-owned evidence
  contract). Decision D3 already binds E7 to a data-only `widget.ts`, not `widget.client.tsx`.

  **In flight (session 4):** wave 9 workflow `wf_e6893a0f-915` — `wave9/e7-bulk-action-progress`,
  `wave9/h7-gov-p2-evidence`, `wave9/c6-search-silent-zero`.

  - **E7 is the largest single runtime slice in the program** (bulk action + durable outbox +
    scheduler target + CAS-leased worker + operation progress). It was told explicitly that a
    coherent SUBSET with real tests beats a complete-looking slice with vacuous ones, and to amend
    the canonical spec's `widget.client.tsx` wording, which contradicts the code — decision D3 binds
    it to a data-only `widget.ts`. Its verifier runs the migration sanity gate line by line and must
    construct a probe that would breach tenant scope if the bulk guard were removed.
  - **C6 chases the `search` silent zero** and, more usefully, sweeps `generator-plugin` / `worker` /
    `vector` to classify each as legitimately-absent vs silently-unreadable. The verifier must
    classify them independently rather than accept C6's answer — after `di-registration` turned out
    to be a claimed capability scoring zero, that whole family of claims is suspect.
  - The agent brief now carries an explicit **anti-vacuous-test section** listing all four real
    examples from this program and the test "what value would make this fail?", because vacuous
    tests are measurably the #1 failure mode here — more common than wrong behaviour.

  Branches local, not pushed. Resume: `Workflow({scriptPath, resumeFromRunId: 'wf_e6893a0f-915'})`.

  **Wave 9 merged (session 4). E7 is deliberately PARTIAL and the boundary is stated, not implied.**

  - **E7 ships the durable operation end to end in UNITS** — CAS-leased outbox entity, dispatch
    worker, bulk-complete route returning a `progressJobId`, data-only bulk widget (D3),
    idempotency-keyed unique constraint. **NOT shipped:** the Playwright proof
    (`TC-EXAMPLE-003`), which needs a live app + database + running queue/scheduler. The slice
    declined to add an integration spec it could not execute. **The browser half — top-bar progress,
    cleared selection, refresh on the terminal event — and the real queue round trip are UNPROVEN.**
    The surface map says so rather than letting a populated `integrationTestPaths` imply otherwise.
    The DB-backed halves (CAS predicate, unique-constraint race, dispatcher scoped find) are tested
    only through injected interfaces, not against Postgres.
  - **Migration passed the sanity gate**: one CREATE TABLE + one unique constraint, one DROP in
    `down()`, no ALTER, no data migration. Verifier parsed both snapshots and diffed semantically —
    exactly one table added.
  - **TWO MORE FALSE PREMISES in inputs I supplied.** (1) The spec said to give the Todo table an
    `extensionTableId`; it already resolves, because DataTable derives it from `perspective?.tableId`
    FIRST and TodosTable already passes the host's. Spec amended. (2) The recon claimed the example
    would be "the first module to seed a ScheduledJob" — four core modules already do, and
    `payment_gateways` already implements the exact degrade-to-warning wrapper I asked the slice to
    invent. It copied the precedent instead. **That is five false premises across nine waves; assume
    briefs are wrong until the agent checks.**
  - **TWO MORE VACUOUS TESTS, and MY FIRST FIX FOR ONE WAS ALSO VACUOUS.** (1) "keeps the version out
    of the persisted column patch" inspected `prepare`'s undo snapshot — built entirely from the DB
    entity, so it structurally could not carry an input key; a mutation genuinely leaking the value
    into the real patch left it green. Now asserts the exported `buildTodoUpdatePatch`. (2)
    "onTenantCreated gets no container" asserted absence of a key the test itself declined to write;
    adding `container?: unknown` to the real type left it green. **My first rewrite used
    `@ts-expect-error` — the jest transform does not fail on an unused directive, so that was vacuous
    too, and my own probe caught it.** It now calls the hook and asserts the scheduler was NOT
    registered. **Lesson: a type-level assertion is NOT enforced by this repo's test transform; pin
    behaviour at runtime.**
  - **C6 fixed the `search` silent zero and added the missing diagnostic**: 47 → 53 entity ids across
    9 → 12 emitting modules, purely additive. More valuable, the one genuinely unreadable case left
    (checkout) now emits 3 warnings pointing at exact lines instead of silently scoring zero.
  - **H7's verifier died**, so I checked its two carried constraints myself: the validator is still
    unwired from CI/config, and the fail-closed CANON-C reason is still accurate. **Realigned on
    merge:** its forward reference pointed the future inventory at `agentic/shared/ai/harness/`, the
    tree wave 7 deliberately moved these assets OUT of because it is copied into every generated app.
    Left alone, the inventory would have landed back inside every scaffold.

  **Gate after wave 9: FULLY GREEN.** `yarn test` exit 0 (25/25), create-mercato-app 580, guards,
  budget, build:app. One locale-sort fix was needed after E7's new strings.

  **Next: wave 10** — C5 (source-link inventory generator + `topicId` on all inventory rows +
  regenerate-and-diff gate; this is what unblocks H7's fail-closed branch and wires the CANON-C
  validators into CI) · H8 (harness source-selection assertions for the bulk-action and
  operation-progress capabilities).

  **In flight (session 4):** wave 10 workflow `wf_a24df3d2-76b` — `wave10/c5-source-link-inventory`
  and `wave10/h8-harness-source-selection`.

  - **C5 is the CANON-C keystone.** The inventory's absence is why TWO things currently fail closed:
    GOV-P2 refuses to resolve source-link/example-source/installed-source contracts, and the CANON-C
    validators are deliberately unwired from `.ai/agentic.config.json` and CI because they would fail
    every PR. C5 was told to re-evaluate both once the inventory exists — but NOT to wire anything
    unless the full gate passes with it enabled, with a green local run as the evidence rather than
    an argument. Its verifier must run the full gate itself if C5 wired anything, since a validator
    that fails every PR is a blocking defect.
  - **Per decision D4**, the generator must assert its derived topic set EQUALS the checked
    `source-link-topics.json` registry exactly — the verifier must construct a probe that breaks that
    equality, not just confirm the assertion exists.
  - The anti-vacuous section of the brief now lists **six** real examples from this program, plus the
    hard-won note that `@ts-expect-error` is NOT enforced by this repo's jest transform, so a
    type-level test is vacuous unless proven otherwise. That one cost a fix-of-a-fix in wave 9.
  - **H8** must check `packages/create-app/AGENT-HARNESS.md` by hand — it is not covered by the count
    guard and has now rotted twice — and pin any new declaring case in `DECLARED_CAPABILITY_IDS`.

  Branches local, not pushed. Resume: `Workflow({scriptPath, resumeFromRunId: 'wf_a24df3d2-76b'})`.

  **Wave 10 merged (session 4). CANON-C's keystone is in.**

  - **C5 defeated an existing anti-staleness gate — caught and fixed on merge.**
    `MISSING_SURFACES['source-link-inventory.json']` probed the OLD
    `agentic/shared/ai/harness/` path, which the inventory will never occupy because wave 7
    deliberately moved these monorepo-only ledgers out of the tree that ships into every generated
    app. The probe would have said "still missing" forever and the three ledger rows naming it as a
    blocker could never go stale — exactly what that gate exists to catch. Repointed; the three rows
    updated (`source-link-inventory.json` is no longer a blocker, `context.sourceReferenceIds` still
    is). **Removing the inventory now fails 23 tests instead of passing silently.**
  - **The drift gate proved itself immediately**: after merging H8's new cases, C5's
    regenerate-and-diff caught the checked inventory as stale (`citedByCaseIds` missing OMH-225).
    Two slices' guards catching each other is the outcome this structure is for.
  - **D4 is a real equality, not a subset.** Two symmetric loops reject both a derived topic the
    registry does not declare and a registry topic nobody renders; `buildInventory` returns null on
    any error so a drifted registry cannot silently regenerate. The verifier broke it in BOTH
    directions through real files. The 25 retained-normative-snippet topics are carried from the
    registry with each literal `evidence` re-verified per run — asymmetry documented, not hidden.
  - **TWO MORE FALSE PREMISES IN MY BRIEF (now SEVEN across ten waves).** (1) I asked for `topicId`
    on surface-inventory rows; the spec does not ask for it — it appears only on the
    source-link-inventory RECORD and on baseline blocks. (2) I described a fail-closed BRANCH to flip
    in the knowledge-change validator; there is none — its CANON-C guard is a file-existence check,
    so the manifest's existence resolves the contracts by itself.
  - **C5 declined to wire the validators into `.ai/agentic.config.json`, with a better reason than
    mine**: they are ALREADY inside the config's `yarn test` step via turbo, so a separate entry
    would duplicate an existing gate and add a second failure surface.
  - It also found that **the wave-7 changelog entry I wrote reports paths that do not exist**, and
    recorded the correction rather than rewriting history.
  - **H8** landed family-11 source-selection coverage; the verifier enumerated 21 catalog-count pins
    plus 6 declaring-set pins with none missed, hand-checking `AGENT-HARNESS.md` as instructed. One
    tautological assertion (`notDeepEqual` between two values already pinned to distinct literals)
    was replaced on merge with the property it was reaching for.

  **FLAKE (new, recorded):** `@open-mercato/core` → `Module Decoupling › resolveDefaultPartitionCode`
  failed once under the full parallel `yarn test`, passed in isolation and on a clean re-run. Not a
  regression. **Gate after wave 10: FULLY GREEN** — `yarn test` exit 0 (25/25), create-mercato-app
  605 pass, guards, budget, build:app.

  **In flight (session 4): waves 11 AND 12 launched together** per maintainer instruction, workflow
  `wf_c82928df-b2a` — `wave11/e8-entity-extensions` and `wave12/s12-blocked-backlog-sweep`.

  - **E8 carries decision D1**: an additive optional `table?: string` on `EntityExtension`, preferred
    by the query engine over its naive pluralizer (`extName + 's'` yields `example_customer_prioritys`
    for the only natural example link). Shipped as SEPARATE commits so the `packages/shared` change
    is reviewable apart from the example change. It was told to verify BOTH recon premises first —
    that `includeExtensions` has zero production call sites, and that the pluralizer really breaks —
    and to ship declaration-only with a plain statement rather than fake a call site if the runtime
    half still cannot be demonstrated honestly.
  - **S12 sweeps the blocked backlog**: the read-policy oracle families whose dependencies have since
    landed (CANON-C's inventory arrived in wave 10), the `generator-plugin` family wave 8 could not
    ship because only the declaration was allowlisted (all three parts are allowlisted now, and it
    must be REAL or not shipped), the three installed-harness docs still asserting
    "No canonical encryption map exists yet" / "the example ships no search.ts", and the two raw
    `em.find(Todo, …)` reads left in `data/enrichers.ts` on a now-encrypted entity.
  - **S12 is explicitly barred from adding or removing harness cases**, because E8 runs concurrently
    and the ~21 count pins would collide. It was also told a claim may be IN FLUX (E8 may be adding
    `data/extensions.ts` while S12 corrects a doc saying it does not exist) and to verify at check
    time rather than assume.
  - Anti-vacuous section now lists **seven** real examples from this program.

  Branches local, not pushed. Resume: `Workflow({scriptPath, resumeFromRunId: 'wf_c82928df-b2a'})`.

## ALL TWELVE WAVES COMPLETE (session 4)

Waves 0-12 are merged. 47 task rows. **Gate FULLY GREEN**: `yarn test` exit 0 (25/25 turbo tasks),
create-mercato-app 606 pass / 0 fail, repo-wide guards (24 files), `agents:check-budget`,
`build:app`, `template:sync`, `i18n:check-sync`, `typecheck`.

**Wave 11 (E8) is deliberately PARTIAL, and the reason matters.** The shared half landed: an additive
optional `table?: string` on `EntityExtension`, preferred by the query engine over its naive
pluralizer. The example half is **declaration-only**, because the slice found TWO reasons beyond the
two the recon knew:
- `HybridQueryEngine` — what `query_index/di.ts` registers as the PRODUCTION `queryEngine` — has no
  reference to `includeExtensions` at all. On the engine actually wired, setting the flag is a
  silent no-op.
- Even on `BasicQueryEngine` the extension join is write-only: selection goes through `qualify()`
  against the BASE table and the joined `ext_*` alias is never projected, filtered or sorted.
So an `includeExtensions` opt-in in `api/todos/route.ts` would have been decorative. **`data/extensions.ts`
cannot be made runtime-observable without a query-engine change well beyond this program's scope.**
The declaration-only status is stated in the file docstring, the inventory description and the
surface-map row.

**Open maintainer decision E8 flagged and correctly did NOT act on:** `engine.ts` already contains a
correct pluralizer (`pluralizeBaseName`, handling `-y` → `-ies`) that would have derived
`example_customer_priorities` right. The extension-join path uses a separate naive inline one. D1 was
binding and behavior preservation is an Always rule, so it implemented the override and reported the
redundancy. **If the maintainer prefers, the override could be dropped in favour of routing the
fallback through the existing pluralizer.**

**Two false claims fixed on merge**, both outside E8's allowlist and correctly reported rather than
silently edited: `om-system-extension/SKILL.md` said `data/extensions.ts` "has no example there"
(that file SHIPS into every generated app), and `BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md`'s row read "MUST NOT
change `EntityExtension` shape" — stricter than §2's "optional fields may be added freely" and than
line 66, which names only `base`/`extension`/`join` as immutable.

**S12** re-derived the read-policy oracle families from the tree rather than the ledger and reported
per-family status honestly; the uncovered ones are blocked on `context.sourceReferenceIds`, which has
ZERO occurrences in both the case schema and the evaluator. It also fixed the two raw `em.find(Todo,…)`
reads in `data/enrichers.ts` on a now-encrypted entity. Its `enrichMany` assertion was tightened on
merge — it checked only argument 1, leaving the where-clause and decryption scope unpinned on the
LIST path while its `enrichOne` sibling asserted the full call.

### Programme tally, for the next session

- **Seven false premises** in briefs I wrote, every one caught by an agent told to verify the brief.
- **Eight vacuous tests** shipped and fixed — the single most common failure mode, more common than
  wrong behaviour. One of MY OWN fixes was vacuous too (`@ts-expect-error` is not enforced by this
  jest transform).
- **Three silent-zero fact families** found and fixed (`di-registration`, `search`, plus the
  diagnostic gap that hid them).
- Two contamination incidents, both caught by the per-slice allowlist + independent verifier.

### Remaining, none blocking

- `TC-EXAMPLE-003` (bulk progress) and `TC-EXAMPLE-007/010` Playwright specs — need a live app,
  database and queue; unit-covered only, and the surface map says so.
- `generator-plugin` fact family — see S12's report.
- `context.sourceReferenceIds` — the last read-policy blocker.
- The `Module Decoupling › resolveDefaultPartitionCode` parallelism flake.
- `umes.component-replacement` is the only `qa-only` row left.

## Session 5 — maintainer decision resolved, develop merged, gate green

### The one open maintainer decision is settled

**Decision: reroute AND keep the override.** `packages/shared/src/lib/query/engine.ts:936` now
derives the extension-join table with `pluralizeBaseName`, the helper defined at the top of the same
file that every other table-name fallback already uses. It previously inlined its own
`extName.endsWith('s') ? extName : extName + 's'`, so any entity name ending in `y` derived a table
that does not exist — `example_customer_priority` → `example_customer_prioritys` against the real
`example_customer_priorities`. That inline pluralizer is the reason E8 needed to add
`EntityExtension.table` at all.

`EntityExtension.table` stays. It is the escape hatch for irregular plurals no guesser can win
(`person` → `people`), and after this change it is a genuine override rather than a workaround for a
bug sitting three lines above it.

Both mechanisms were proved independently load-bearing before commit, by mutation:
- Reverting the reroute → the `-y` case fails again (1 failed / 186).
- The `table` override still wins where declared; the fixture suite does not silently depend on it.

The pre-existing test asserted `example_role_policys` — it pinned the defect rather than the
contract, and is corrected in the same commit. Behaviour is unchanged for every module whose entity
name does not end in `y`.

### `origin/develop` merged (`e2794a146`)

Two conflicts, both resolved by keeping BOTH sides — neither was a real disagreement:

1. `UPGRADE_NOTES.md` — develop's workflow-template entry (#4334) and our injection-flag removal
   entry are independent additions under the same unreleased heading. Develop's is placed first to
   preserve upstream order.
2. `packages/cli/src/lib/generators/__tests__/module-facts.bc-guard.test.ts` — develop raised the
   CPU cap 30s → 90s (CI was sitting exactly on the line at 30,052.8ms); we raised the JSON byte cap
   3.50MB → 3.56MB for the twelve recovered injection contributions. Different caps, different
   rationales, both kept with both comments.

### Inherited failure found and fixed — NOT ours

`storage-s3-routes.test.ts › rejects uploads that exceed tenant quota` failed after the merge.
Root-caused rather than assumed: `packages/storage-s3/**` and the test file are **byte-identical to
`origin/develop`** on this branch (`git diff --stat origin/develop HEAD --` is empty for both), so
the failure is inherited.

Cause: #4887 localized every error response in the S3 upload/signed-url routes; #4076 (atomic quota
admission, merged into develop after it) rewrote the quota path around fenced leases and re-emitted
the 413 body as a raw English literal. The route returned the correct status and text but never
called `t`, which is exactly what the test asserts.

Fixed by restoring `t('storage_s3.errors.quotaExceeded', …)` at all three call sites (two in
`upload.ts`, one in `signed-url.ts`). This introduces nothing: the key exists in all five locales,
and `t` was already in scope in both files — every other error in them uses it.

**Left alone deliberately:** two other strings #4076 added (`quota_target_exists`, and the
accounting-unavailable 500) are still hardcoded and have **no locale keys at all**. Inventing keys in
another module's i18n is that change's debt to settle, not this branch's. Worth a follow-up issue.

### Korean locale

Develop added `ko.json` (#4912). The seven example-module keys this branch introduced were missing
from it. `yarn i18n:check-sync --fix` writes English placeholders, and the rest of that file is
genuinely translated, so the placeholders were replaced with real Korean and mirrored into the
template (`yarn template:sync:fix`).

### Gate (local runner; Docker still unavailable in this WSL distro) — fully green at `ea9930b56`

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `yarn build:packages` | 22/22 |
| `yarn generate` | ok |
| `yarn i18n:check-sync` | all in sync |
| `yarn i18n:check-usage` | advisory only |
| `yarn typecheck` | 22/22 |
| `yarn test` | **25/25 tasks, exit 0** |
| `yarn build:app` | ok |
| `node scripts/repo-wide-guards.mjs` | 27 files, all passed |
| `yarn agents:check-budget` | exit 0 (overages are pre-existing baselines; all four chains shrank) |
| `yarn template:sync` | in sync |

PR state after push: `MERGEABLE` (`BLOCKED` is the review requirement only), 100 commits,
312 files.

## Session 5b — spec-completeness audit (three independent read-only auditors)

Each auditor was told to ignore this plan and the PR body and confirm every requirement against
source, greps and real test runs. Load-bearing findings were re-verified by hand before publishing.

**Verdict: no spec is fully implemented, and that is mostly by design** — the user-directed scope
decision at the top of this file delivers Milestone A + foundations, with the rest in the Deferred
Backlog. The twelve waves went well past that floor. "All waves complete" was never "all specs
complete"; the PR comment now says so explicitly.

### Defects in shipped work (not deferred scope) — the "apparently satisfied" class

1. GOV `sourceLinkInventory`: seven schema-**required** fields (`expectedOwnerCount`,
   `expectedTopicCount`, `resolvedLinkCount`, `baselineAssetCount`, `baselineDispositionCount`,
   `baselinePath`, `baselineSchemaPath`) have **zero** reads in `validate-knowledge-change.mjs`.
   Verified each independently. A manifest passes with fabricated numbers.
2. `source-link-baseline.schema.json` does not exist; the schema requires a path to it.
3. `source-link-parity-ledger.json` does not exist; its classifier branch is unreachable.
4. `context.sourceReferenceIds` absent from schema AND evaluator — kills READ-P oracle family 4.
5. Reason-gated fallback unreachable in the shipped catalog (0/216 cases), locked by a test.
6. SPEC-P decision row 6 (`reuse-spec`) has no read-only case — the spec's own exit criterion.
7. Cosmetic: `validators.json:42` names `validateSpecRoutingDecision`; the export is
   `evaluateSpecRoutingDecision`. Documentary only, nothing dispatches on it.

### Fixed this session (`89dcece58`) — stale claims in shipped docs

Same defect class this branch already corrected twice, so fixed rather than reported:
- CANON spec changelog claimed Milestone B unimplemented while much of it is shipped and green.
  New entry records what landed AND what B still lacks, so no reader infers completion.
- `CANON_C_REASON` claimed the inventory "has not landed" — it has, in the monorepo. It stays
  monorepo-only, so the fail-closed branch is still live in a scaffolded app; text now says that.
- `knowledge-change.md` justified the out-of-CI position with that resolved reason; the two reasons
  that actually remain are now named.

### One audit finding was NOT a gap

"Normalize every `injectionTable` slot to an array" is unfixed at the source but was satisfied at the
**reader** (`module-extension-facts.ts` → `injectionTableSlots`). Stronger fix: the array-only reader
dropped twelve real contributions across six modules; rewriting only the example's table would have
left every other module misread. Recorded in the spec.

### Next session starts here

1. The fifteen `TC-EXAMPLE-003…017` integration specs — Milestone B's own hard gate.
2. `context.sourceReferenceIds` (schema + evaluator + trace).
3. **Maintainer decision needed:** make the GOV `sourceLinkInventory` block read its seven required
   fields, or stop requiring them. Schema contract change — deliberately not picked unilaterally.
4. SPEC-P row 6 + module-shaped writable-proof oracle clauses.
5. PR #4883 `factCoverage` / #4301 design-system / #4277 design-foundation — all absent; #4883
   still upstream-blocked.
6. `frontend/middleware.ts`, `generators.ts`, `aiToolOverrides`/`aiAgentOverrides`, vector/workflow/
   currency identities, `componentOverrides` `replace` + `props`.
7. Milestone D certification — untouched, blocked on the above.

## Session 6 — `develop` merged again (case-ID collision), re-review findings addressed

Entered via `/om-auto-continue-pr 4897` on the changes-requested re-review of `5b4be4bc`. Two jobs:
resolve the merge conflicts, and close the two findings.

### The merge was not mechanical: both sides claimed OMH-204..213

`develop` published ten new harness cases (`OMH-204`–`OMH-213`, all `analysis`/routing, from the
module-facts-required and routing-timeout work) while this branch had already added thirteen of its
own under the same numbers. Nine files conflicted; `cases.json` alone had 25 hunks, and the collision
is invisible in a textual diff because both sides look like clean appends.

Resolved in `develop`'s favour — its ten keep the IDs it already published — and this branch's
thirteen are renumbered **`OMH-204..216` → `OMH-214..226`** everywhere they are named:
`cases.json` (rebuilt by splicing element texts so the file's hand-inlined arrays survive byte-exact),
`release-matrix.json`, `validators.json`, `writable-spec-oracles.mjs`, the regenerated
`source-link-inventory.json`, `agent-harness-evaluator.test.ts`,
`agent-harness-example-read-policy.test.ts`, `AGENT-HARNESS.md`, and the two harness specs.
Published counts follow: **226 cases, 48 writable (21.2%), 48-case portability sample**, and the
schema id pattern widens to `OMH-226`. `every published case count states the shipped catalog or the
portability sample` and `the published case schema accepts the shipped catalog it pins` both pass —
they are what makes this renumbering checkable rather than hopeful.

`packages/shared/src/lib/bootstrap/dynamicLoader.ts` conflicted for a subtler reason: `develop` added
a shared esbuild runtime (`getEsbuildRuntime` + `withEsbuildLifecycle`, so bootstrap compilation stops
its helper process) and edited the call site inside `compileAndImport` — the exact function this
branch had extracted into `compileAppSourceFile`. Git aligned the hunk into the new function. Taking
either side alone would have been wrong: `compileAppSourceFile` now calls `getEsbuildRuntime()`, so
app-source compilation joins that lifecycle instead of starting a second helper nothing stops.

### Re-review findings

- **Major — contract changes documented only in the PR description.** Four value changes land against
  `BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md` §14's STABLE generated-facts surface (the `ComponentReplacementHandles`
  contribution IDs, the `section:auth.login.form` `mode`, the twelve recovered injection-table
  contributions, the extension-join pluralizer) plus the `ExtractAllModuleFactsResult` required field
  and the additive `ListConfig.csv` widening. They are now in `UPGRADE_NOTES.md` under
  `0.6.7 → 0.6.8 (unreleased)` with migration guidance, and the canonical spec's Backward
  Compatibility section no longer asserts the opposite of what shipped (`ee8be0729`).
- **Major follow-up — documentation alone did not bridge stable generated values.** The final
  compatibility boundary preserves `.ai/guides/module-facts.json` as a source-generated v1
  projection and emits corrected `.ai/guides/module-facts.v2.json` additively. Generated harness
  consumers prefer v2 with a v1 fallback; build, scaffold ownership, component-ID/mode, recovered
  injection-slot, and reader-preference regressions cover both projections.
- **Minor — `EntityExtension.table`'s JSDoc still described the defect this PR fixed.** It had four
  more copies, all introduced here: the example module's `data/extensions.ts` docstring, its
  `surface-inventory.json` row, both template mirrors, and a comment in the engine tests. All say
  what is true now; the example keeps its `table` declaration as the escape-hatch demonstration its
  inventory row claims (`ba4ebba1f`).
- **Note — the unbound `sales.injection.payment-gateway-status-column`.** The removal note said
  "tracked separately" without saying where. Filed as **#5142** and named at the site (`3d5706359`).

### Gate (local runner; no compose `app` container in this WSL distro)

`build:packages`, `generate`, `build:packages`, `i18n:check-sync`, `i18n:check-usage`, `typecheck`
green (22/22 turbo tasks). `test` and `build:app` run after; results recorded on the PR.

## Session 7 — the red `audit` job (inherited, not ours)

Both fixes are post-review, outside the wave plan: the `audit` job was red on this PR while the
branch's `yarn.lock` was byte-identical to `develop`'s. `audit-scope` only schedules the job when a
manifest changes, so `develop`'s own pushes report it `skipped` and every manifest-touching PR
inherits the red. Filed upstream as **#5144**.

- [x] Post-review fix: pin `nanoid` to 3.3.18, clearing GHSA-2v37-7h3g-55p8 (postcss 8.5.22 is the
  only dependent and requests `^3.3.16`, so the pin stays inside the declared range) — `3e91b0a51`
- [x] Post-review fix: `.audit-allowlist.json` + waiver support in `scripts/audit-ci.mjs` for the two
  `image-size` advisories — `9a3b998cb`, **superseded and reverted by the `develop` merge below**

### Both halves landed independently on `develop` while this session was running

`develop` merged **#5157** (`4792c7717`) about ninety minutes after this session started, carrying the
same two halves: `dcb670592` pins `nanoid` to 3.3.17, and `1fc0c3527` adds
`scripts/audit-ci-allowlist.json` plus GHSA-keyed exception partitioning in `scripts/audit-ci.mjs`.
The merge therefore takes **`develop`'s mechanism wholesale** and drops this branch's parallel
implementation entirely: `.audit-allowlist.json` deleted, `scripts/audit-ci.mjs` and its test file
resolved to `origin/develop`, and the `nanoid` pin resolved to their descriptor-keyed
`"nanoid@npm:^3.3.16": "3.3.17"`. Two allowlist mechanisms in one repository would have been the
defect, and theirs follows the established `scripts/logger-console-allowlist.json` convention.

`package.json` **auto-merged without a conflict** into two competing `nanoid` resolutions (their
descriptor-keyed 3.3.17 and this branch's bare 3.3.18). Git could not see it; only reading the merged
`resolutions` block did. Their justification is also the better one — it records that
`image-size/image-size` is *archived upstream*, which this session's research had not established.

Two properties of the reverted implementation are **not** in `develop`'s, and belong in a follow-up
against their file rather than resurrected here: a mandatory expiry (`MAX_WAIVER_DAYS`, so a waiver
cannot outlive its review) and matching on the exact vulnerable range the registry reports (so a
re-scoped advisory stops being covered).

### Why a waiver at all, when `2026-08-04-audit-gate-transitive-dep-bumps.md` ruled allowlists out

That run's non-goal ("the gate must go green because the graph is fixed") assumed a fix exists. For
GHSA-w3rx-r6r6-pgpr and GHSA-5p2g-fcmc-qvqq it does not: 2.0.2 is the newest `image-size` npm has
ever published, both advisories cover `<=2.0.2`, and the GitHub advisory API reports
`first_patched_version: null` for both. No bump, resolution or lockfile edit can clear them, so the
alternative to a waiver is a permanently red gate on an unrepairable graph. Maintainer decision
taken this session: ship the waiver — which `develop` then settled its own way, as recorded above.

The mechanism is built to fail closed rather than to soften the gate. A waiver must name the GHSA
id, the package, the exact vulnerable range the registry reports, a reason and an expiry no more
than `MAX_WAIVER_DAYS` (90) out; a malformed entry exits 2 *before* the scan runs, a re-scoped
advisory stops matching, an expired waiver suppresses nothing, a waiver matching nothing is printed
as stale, and every suppression is printed on every run. `image-size` reaches the graph only from
`apps/docs` through `@docusaurus/mdx-loader`, which sizes repo-authored images at documentation
build time — no runtime package or app depends on it.

### Gate (local runner; no compose `app` container in this WSL distro)

`build:packages`, `generate` (no drift), `build:packages`, `i18n:check-sync`, `i18n:check-usage`,
`typecheck`, `build:app` green. `test`: 24/24 turbo tasks pass (core alone 1198 suites / 9256
tests); the sole failure is `create-mercato-app`'s `template-dev-log-files.test.ts` asserting this
host's inotify limits (`max_user_watches` 253174, `max_user_instances` 128 against the required
4194304/4096) — the documented host-environment class, unreachable from a transitive patch bump or
a CI script.

## Session 7b — GOV declared-integration-test check, and the sequenced plan for what remains

- [x] GOV Phase 2: declared-integration-test check — `exampleCoverageErrors` /
  `readExampleCapabilityRows` in `validate-knowledge-change.mjs`, +9 tests (57 total). Details and the
  app-relative path defect it uncovered are in the GOV spec's 2026-08-10 changelog entry.

Chosen first because it is the gate that *mechanically* prevents the failure mode this session nearly
walked into: the Milestone B matrix names one exact file per row, so a partial spec written at a
spec-reserved `TC-EXAMPLE-0NN` path reads as completion to every downstream reader. The check refuses a
new `coverageKind: "example"` surface that declares no integration coverage, and ratchets so declared
coverage can never quietly drop to zero.

### Verified state of the four specs (checked against the tree, not against this plan's older sections)

Several rows in the Deferred Backlog above are **stale** and should not be re-worked: CANON-C's
source-link assets have landed (inventory 126 records all `readable`, baseline with 8 assets and 136
fence dispositions, plus `source-link-baseline.schema.json`), READ Phase 1 is fully closed including
the broad-glob migration (0 cases still carry `node_modules/@open-mercato/*/src/**`) and
`context.sourceReferenceIds`, and SPEC's `reuse-spec` row now has its case.

### Sequenced plan for the remainder

Ordered by unblocked-ness, not by spec order. Every row states its blocker honestly.

| # | Work | Blocker | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | GOV: per-case-mode oracle-membership check | none | Same shape as the check that just landed: derive required validators/oracles per case `mode`, compare against `validators.json` + the oracle modules. Fully unit-testable. |
| 2 | GOV: packed-target hash check | none | Spec line 97: compare every generated/template/packed-target hash with its authoritative source. `checkFileRecords` already models the generated/authoritative pair. |
| 3 | `TC-EXAMPLE-012` | none — wave-sized | The static half largely exists in `module-facts.example-fact-coverage.test.ts` (30 tests). The new value is the **live call site** proof: the enricher really enriching `customers` responses (assert `_example.priority` equal to a created priority row — the declared `fallback` is `normal`, so a non-fallback value cannot be faked), the guard really refusing in its own words, the command callers, cross-module incoming indexes, portal reaction. Needs the ephemeral env. |
| 4 | SPEC Phase 2 | none | Remaining routing cases + writable ordering proofs. |
| 5 | READ Phase 2 | none for the phase | Families 8/9 stay partial on their own missing surfaces; do not claim them. |
| 6 | `TC-EXAMPLE-015` | **module surfaces absent** | The vector, workflow and currency provider identities it asserts do not exist in the example module. Build those first; the spec is downstream of that, not of the test lane. |
| 7 | `TC-EXAMPLE-016` | **wrong harness** | Needs a disposable *activated* app, which is `test:create-app`, not the Playwright integration lane. |
| 8 | Two-boot create-app integration harness | architecture | `scripts/test-create-app-integration.ts` boots one ephemeral app and cannot host two mutually-exclusive module sets, so the 22 example specs currently run against an app registering neither `example` nor `design_system`. Until this is fixed those specs are not trustworthy as standalone coverage. |
| 9 | GOV: certified-release-lane run | depends on 1, 2 | No synthetic end-to-end change has been driven through a real certified lane yet. |
| 10 | Milestone D certification | depends on 3, 6, 7 | Deliberately unclaimed while B's gate is 12/15. |

The last `qa-only` row in the example inventory (`testing.integration-coverage`) is intentionally
repository-only validation evidence. It does not become readable merely because the missing test
cases land; any status change would require an explicit contract decision.

### Test environment for rows 3 and 8

`om-prepare-test-env` compiled `.ai/scripts/test-env-up.sh` / `test-env-down.sh` on this machine
(gitignored, machine-local, regenerate per checkout). Cold 186s, warm reuse 1s, descriptor
`.ai/qa/test-env.json`. Any run after a source change needs `--force-rebuild`, not `--force`.

- [x] GOV Phase 2: per-case-mode oracle-membership check — `caseModeMembershipErrors` /
  `touchesCaseMembershipSurface`, +11 tests (68 total). Row 1 of the Session 7b table. Details, and the
  two-shapes-of-oracle distinction the first draft got wrong, are in the GOV spec's second 2026-08-10
  changelog entry. Remaining GOV work is the packed-target check (row 2) and the certified-release-lane
  run (row 9).
- [x] GOV Phase 2: packed-target check — `generatedTargetErrors`, +5 tests (73 total). Row 2 of the
  Session 7b table. Mirror-ness is derived from the base commit rather than assumed, because the
  template stub pair is a deliberate non-mirror. **All three pending GOV Phase 2 checks are now done**;
  the remaining GOV item is the certified-release-lane run (row 9), which needs a real lane execution
  rather than more validator code.

## Session 8 — canonical gap-completion audit and implementation

Re-entered through `om-auto-continue-pr` after auditing the canonical, READ, SPEC, and GOV contracts
against the branch itself. The PR description's prior completion claim was incorrect: the acceptance
matrix remained 12/15 and Milestone D had not been certified. Work resumes from the executable gaps,
not from the stale deferred/blocker labels above.

- [x] GOV: make the repo-local `om-refresh-standalone-harness` workflow explicitly enter the bundled
  nine-step knowledge-change contract, require the machine manifest and affected certified lane, and
  retain only sanitized evidence. Added a focused guard in
  `agent-harness-knowledge-change.test.ts`; fail-before and pass-after were both observed.
- [x] TC-EXAMPLE-012 and complete topology/fact enumeration. The focused live lane passed 2/2,
  including the real non-fallback enricher/command path and a scoped customer-portal SSE reaction.
- [x] TC-EXAMPLE-015 and the missing vector/integration/workflow/currency identities. The focused live
  lane passed 2/2 and the specialized-registry unit suite passed 7/7.
- [x] TC-EXAMPLE-016, deterministic generator plugin, and activated disposable create-app lane. The
  full standalone controller passed 1/1 after disabled and activated production builds, generation
  repeat parity, bootstrap-consumer proof, real database/app boot, and cleanup.
- [x] READ/SPEC design-gallery, foundation, topology-routing, preset/tier, and connected-progress proofs.
  All twelve read-policy families are covered, including distinct OMH-228 design-foundation routing.
- [x] READ: document the live fallback reason/capability channel and adopt it in the bounded OMH-203
  installed-version-mismatch lane; route the generated local example reference sheet from OMH-223.
- [x] READ family 9: reuse writable OMH-181 to select both canonical bulk-action/progress seams and
  prove the returned `progressJobId` is connected to the operation-progress observer. Focused READ
  tests pass 61/61 and the business writable oracle suite passes 12/12 top-level tests.
- [ ] Milestone D: the 15/15 runtime matrix is complete (43/43 randomized; 86 repeated executions;
  the only repeated-run race was fixed and then proved 6/6 with retries disabled), the activated
  standalone lane is 1/1, packed source links are 136/136 with 130 topics / 29 owners / 107 rendered
  links, and the 113-item / 17-family design projection has zero mismatches. The knowledge-change
  controller passed base-fail/head-pass with all six required lanes declared. Remaining release gates:
  the trusted provider-backed harness lane must run on Linux with Bubblewrap (native macOS fails closed
  by design), followed by the final CI result.
- [x] Fresh-scaffold deterministic harness: the final audit found that build-time
  `reference-module-facts.json` and `reference-modules/example.md` were not copied by
  `generateShared()` or owned by the harness manifest. Both now ship without activating `example`,
  and a real fresh classic scaffold proves the files and ownership entries. The same run exposed byte
  ceilings calibrated before the expanded installed module-fact topology; all affected cases were
  remeasured against packed and current-source controllers, rounded to the next 4 KiB, and the bounded
  catalog ceiling was raised to 1 MiB. The corrected generated controller passes 228/228 deterministic
  cases; focused evaluator, budget, build, and fresh-scaffold tests pass 164/164.
- [x] Hosted-CI stabilization of the four failures on run 31537975925 (head `2a4765f33`), each at its
  own root cause rather than by relaxing an assertion. (a) The example `crud-validation` widget's
  `transformDisplayData` rewrote every title it saw. It had been dead code: CrudForm keyed its
  initial-values effect without injection-widget ids, so widgets resolving asynchronously never
  re-ran it. This branch added `injectionWidgetIds` to that key — the documented behaviour — and the
  blanket `toUpperCase()` then reached every CrudForm host that mounts the widget, including
  `crud-form:catalog.product` / `catalog.variant`, whose forms also carry a `title`. Because CrudForm
  writes the transform's result into the form's own values, the next submit would have persisted it.
  The handler now opts in on a `[display]` marker, mirroring `transformFormData`'s `[transform]`;
  TC-EXAMPLE-017 marks its records and gained a counter-check that an unmarked record is untouched,
  plus a six-case unit test that a restored unconditional rewrite kills 3 of. (b)
  `todoBulkComplete.loop.test.ts` slept a fixed 20ms and asserted a 5ms heartbeat had ticked, so it
  measured runner scheduling latency; both affected cases now poll. (c) TC-EXAMPLE-015's queued-
  delivery case declared two 20s polls, a CLI-spawning drain and two 5s stability windows inside the
  suite's flat 20s budget — it takes 11.6s on an idle machine, so it could not survive a loaded
  worker; it is now `test.slow()`. (d) TC-AUTH-041 provisions two tenants (each running every
  module's `onTenantCreated`), three organizations and three users under the same 20s budget; also
  `test.slow()`. The `apps/docs` `search-index.json` ENOENT in the same job needed no fix: develop's
  green run reaches "Compiled successfully", the failing run stops after "Compiling Server" — turbo
  cancelled the docs build when `@open-mercato/app#test` failed. Verified locally on an ephemeral
  environment with enterprise modules and `OM_OPTIMISTIC_LOCK=all`: TC-UMES-003, TC-UMES-009,
  TC-EXAMPLE-011, TC-EXAMPLE-015, TC-EXAMPLE-017 and TC-AUTH-041 pass 37/37 with zero flakes.
