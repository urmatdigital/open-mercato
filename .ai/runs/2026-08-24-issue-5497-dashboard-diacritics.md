# Execution plan — finish the dashboard diacritics fix without closing the broader locale issue (adopted from PR #5539)

**Origin:** adopted — reconstructed by `om-auto-continue-pr` on 2026-08-24 because PR #5539 carried no execution plan.
**PR:** #5539 · **Branch:** `fix/issue-5497-dashboard-diacritics` · **Base:** `develop`
**Author:** @haxiorz — this plan interprets the PR and review intent; correct it by editing this file or commenting on the PR.

## 🎯 Goal

Ship the verified dashboard comparison-label corrections while keeping issue #5497 open and accurately tracking its remaining repository-wide Polish and Spanish catalog scope.

## Scope

- Preserve the eleven Polish and Spanish dashboard comparison-label corrections and their exact regression assertions.
- Address the requested review change by replacing the closing issue keyword with a non-closing reference.
- Record the dashboard-only coverage on issue #5497 so its remaining locale sweep stays visible.
- Re-run the configured validation gate and the authoritative PR review workflow.

## Non-goals

- Correct every remaining stripped diacritic across all Polish and Spanish catalogs.
- Add or redesign a repository-wide orthography lint rule.
- Reword dashboard labels beyond restoring the intended diacritics.

## Evidence

| Conclusion | Drawn from | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| The existing code and regression test correctly fix eleven dashboard labels. | PR #5539 diff and the completed review by @pkarw | high |
| PR #5539 must not close issue #5497. | Issue #5497's approximately 85-string scope and the requested-change review | high |
| The remaining catalog sweep should stay separate from this small verified fix. | Reviewer's preferred remedy and the PR's dashboard-only title/body/diff | high |
| No inline review feedback remains to address. | GitHub review-thread and inline-comment APIs | high |

## Assumptions

- “Fix issue” means resolving the actionable PR review finding while preserving the broader tracker issue for follow-up, because the review explicitly recommends that narrower and more reversible resolution.
- The existing exact assertions remain the appropriate regression coverage for this PR; the reviewer classified a broader deny-list test as an optional nit that does not affect the verdict.

## Risks

- A closing keyword could be reintroduced later and prematurely retire #5497; the PR body and issue comment will make the intended partial scope explicit.
- The residual locale defects remain user-visible until separate work completes #5497; this PR deliberately does not hide or close that scope.

## Validation Record

- Runner: local, using the bundled Node.js v24.19.0 runtime; no Docker Compose `app` service was running.
- `yarn build:packages` — passed before and after generation.
- `yarn generate` — passed with no tracked generated drift.
- `yarn i18n:check-sync` — passed; all five locale sets are synchronized.
- `yarn i18n:check-usage` — passed with advisory unused-key output only.
- `yarn typecheck` — passed across all configured package tasks.
- `yarn test` — passed across all 33 workspace tasks. Two earlier attempts encountered unrelated Jest worker `SIGSEGV`s under concurrent machine load; both affected suites passed serially, and the final exact full command passed.
- `yarn build:app` — passed; existing Turbopack dynamic-filesystem warnings remained non-blocking.
- `yarn template:sync` — passed; the create-app template and package dependencies remain synchronized.

## Review Record

- The authoritative `om-code-review` pass found no actionable blocker, major, minor, or nit findings and returned an approve verdict.
- Full review report: https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato/pull/5539#pullrequestreview-5003870241
- GitHub does not permit the PR author to submit a formal approving review, so the clean report was submitted as a comment review and the independent maintainer re-review remains required.
- The previous requested change is resolved: the PR references rather than closes #5497, and the issue contains a dashboard-only scope note listing all eleven corrected values.
