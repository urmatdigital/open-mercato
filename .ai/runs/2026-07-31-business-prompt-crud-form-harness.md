# Business-Prompt Complete Module Harness — Execution Plan

Source doc: .ai/specs/2026-07-24-standalone-ai-development-harness.md

## Goal

Add OMH-193 as a business-language counterpart to OMH-185 that must produce the same complete searchable, extensible, localized library module—including canonical `DataTable` and `CrudForm` CRUD surfaces—without naming those technical choices in the user prompt.

## Scope

- Preserve OMH-185 and every existing case contract while adding one contiguous case ID.
- Reuse OMH-185's required routing, decisions, context, fixture, oracle, allowed writes, and timeout so the contrast measures prompt abstraction rather than a weaker outcome.
- Synchronize catalog counts, writable/review/release assignments, fixture ownership, focused contract tests, harness documentation, and the existing harness spec.
- Run the new case before changing its knowledge owner, retain only sanitized failure evidence, and tune the smallest owner only when the focused result proves a gap.
- Iterate the focused OMH-193 live writable evaluation and its generated target checks until it passes, plus targeted OMH-185 compatibility and catalog/unit checks.

## Non-goals

- Do not rewrite or weaken OMH-185, its oracle, or any existing evaluation.
- Do not add prompt-level `CrudForm`, `DataTable`, route-path, file-path, command, locking, encryption, search, UMES, migration, or test implementation instructions to OMH-193.
- Do not change runtime framework contracts, product UI, database schema, or generated application files.
- Per the task brief, do not run the repository's full validation command list or the complete all-case release suite; report the focused evidence and this deliberate validation boundary on the PR.
- Do not absorb the still-open PR #4757 diff; this follow-up remains merge-order compatible and references its additive OMH-185 oracle strengthening.

## Risks

- A second complete-module case can drift from OMH-185; shared fixtures/oracles, explicit parity tests, and OMH-193's one-way related-case link mitigate that risk without mutating OMH-185.
- Business wording may under-route UI or extension guidance; failure-first evidence determines whether the shared business blueprint needs the smallest durable clarification.
- Adding a writable release case raises catalog and release counts; every registry and documented total must stay synchronized without changing existing IDs.
- The focused live generation is model-dependent and can exhaust its case timeout; availability or timeout failures must remain failures rather than being converted into passes.
- The passing target's generated-code review could not be replayed after target validation changed its protected fingerprint. The discovered 16-file review cap was corrected and regression-tested for the canonical 22-file slice; later fresh model attempts remained strict failures and were retained as such rather than substituted for the passing evidence. The PR-level authoritative review completed with no findings.

## Focused Verification Evidence

- Live writable OMH-193: PASS with all 15 decisions, all mandatory procedures, the shared OMH-185 oracle, before-fail/after-pass evidence, and no violations (`2026-07-31T16-41-00-469Z-codex-OMH-193.json`).
- Deterministic OMH-185 and OMH-193: PASS (1/1 each).
- Focused catalog/evaluator/oracle tests: PASS (111/111); the review-cap follow-up suite passed 96/96.
- Passing generated target: `yarn generate`, `yarn typecheck`, `yarn lint` (zero errors), and `yarn build` all passed. The focused generated Jest command was blocked before test loading by the standalone Jest/MikroORM ESM transform boundary.
- GitHub checks on the final implementation head passed: prepare/package build and generation, lint, test/typecheck/i18n/template parity, audit-scope, CodeQL, and CLA.
- Repository-wide local validation and the complete release suite were intentionally not run, per the task brief.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Contrastive case and failure-first evidence

- Add OMH-193 with a business-only library brief and exact OMH-185 outcome-contract parity.
- Synchronize catalog metadata, fixture/oracle/release registries, focused contract tests, documentation, and the harness spec.
- Run the schema-valid focused case before any owner change and record sanitized failure evidence.

### Phase 2: Smallest-owner optimization

- Classify focused failures against semantic decisions and update only the complete-module business blueprint when the evidence shows missing inference.
- Add regression assertions that preserve business-language abstraction and OMH-185 compatibility.

### Phase 3: Focused proof and delivery

- Iterate OMH-193's live writable evaluation, generated target commands/tests, and generated-code review until the fixed oracle passes.
- Run targeted catalog, OMH-185 compatibility, mandatory safety, and create-app harness unit checks without expanding to the full repository gate.
- Complete the authoritative PR review/autofix pass and publish the final focused verification evidence.
