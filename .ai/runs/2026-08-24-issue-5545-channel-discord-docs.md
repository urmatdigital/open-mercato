# Run: channel-discord documentation (issue #5545)

**Issue:** [#5545](https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato/issues/5545) — `docs(channel-discord): official Discord integration guide + developer guide for building on the communications hub`
**Base branch:** `develop`
**Branch:** `feat/issue-5545-channel-discord-docs`
**Source doc:** `.ai/specs/2026-06-19-discord-communication-channel-integration.md` (lives on the #4391 branch, not on `develop`)

## Goal

Ship the two documentation pages #4391 deliberately left out: an operator guide for connecting a
Discord bot, and a developer guide for consuming the Communications Hub from another module and for
building a new provider on it — with the first release's capability ceiling stated honestly.

## Scope

- **New:** `apps/docs/docs/user-guide/communication-channels-discord.mdx` — operator guide.
- **New:** `apps/docs/docs/framework/modules/building-communication-channel-provider.mdx` — developer
  guide, `channel-discord` as the worked example, mirroring the shape of the existing
  `building-gateway-provider.mdx`.
- **Edit:** `apps/docs/docs/framework/modules/communication-channels.mdx` — list Discord among the
  shipping providers, link the new developer guide.
- **Edit:** `apps/docs/docs/user-guide/communication-channels.mdx`, `…-gmail.mdx`, `…-imap.mdx` —
  enumerate Discord, cross-link from "Related".
- **Edit:** `apps/docs/sidebars.ts` — both new pages reachable from the nav; add the hub's framework
  page, which is currently orphaned from the sidebar.

### Dependency

The provider package (`packages/channel-discord`) is **not on `develop`** — it ships with
[#4391](https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato/pull/4391), still open. Every fact in these
pages is taken from that branch's source, not from the spec (which is stale in places: it names an
interactions URL and a `register-slash-commands` CLI command the implementation does not ship). This
PR must therefore land **after** #4391, or the docs describe a package the installation does not have.

### Non-goals

- No code changes to `packages/channel-discord` or to the hub. Documentation only.
- Do not document AI auto-reply as a feature (#4778) or slash-command round-trip (#4663) as working.
- Do not fix the hub gaps the writing exposes (`/send-as-user` still validates recipients as email
  addresses, so it rejects a Discord snowflake). Document the limitation; fixing it is out of scope.
- No changes to `.env.example` — the `OM_CHANNEL_DISCORD_*` entries ship with #4391.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 — Operator guide

Follow the Gmail/IMAP guide structure: prerequisites → create the Discord application and bot →
privileged intents → invite the bot with the right scopes and permissions → connect the channel in
Open Mercato → Interactions Endpoint URL (`/api/channel_discord/interactions`) → run the gateway
worker → env presets → test → capability ceiling → troubleshooting → related links.

### Phase 2 — Developer guide

Two audiences on one page: (a) *consume* the hub from your own module — subscribe to
`communication_channels.message.received`, read the payload, send back through the generic outbound
path; (b) *build* a provider — the `ChannelAdapter` contract, capabilities as a contract (with
Discord's `false` flags and their reasons), fail-closed `verifyWebhook`, the gateway/queue pattern
for non-webhook transports, tenant-scoped state, health check, registration and packaging.

### Phase 3 — Cross-links, enumeration and navigation

### Phase 4 — Validation gate

Docs-only run: run the repo's docs build plus the advisory checkers that touch the changed files,
then re-read the diff.

## Risks

- **Merge ordering.** Documented above; called out in the PR body and summary comment.
- **Drifting from #4391.** #4391 has `CHANGES_REQUESTED`; a later revision could move a detail these
  pages state. Mitigated by sourcing every claim from code rather than prose, and by keeping the
  capability table close to `lib/capabilities.ts`.
- **Over-promising.** The spec over-promised `threading` / `fileSharing` / `interactiveComponents`
  once already. The capability table here is copied from the shipped file, not the spec.

## Progress

PR: #5587

> Convention: `- [ ]` pending, `- [x]` done. Append ` — <commit sha>` when a step lands. Do not rename step titles.

### Phase 1: Operator guide

- [x] 1.1 Write `apps/docs/docs/user-guide/communication-channels-discord.mdx` — a963a6687

### Phase 2: Developer guide

- [x] 2.1 Write `apps/docs/docs/framework/modules/building-communication-channel-provider.mdx` — 30ef40fde

### Phase 3: Cross-links and navigation

- [x] 3.1 Enumerate Discord and link the new pages from the hub + user-guide pages — 5b6554a40
- [x] 3.2 Add both pages (and the orphaned hub page) to `apps/docs/sidebars.ts` — 5b6554a40

### Phase 4: Validation

- [x] 4.1 Run the docs build and the advisory checkers; re-read the diff — 899828d13

Runner: **local** (no compose `app` container running; only `mercato-postgres` / `-redis` /
`-meilisearch`).

The full configured gate was run in order, all green:

| # | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `yarn build:packages` | ✅ |
| 2 | `yarn generate` | ✅ |
| 3 | `yarn build:packages` | ✅ |
| 4 | `yarn i18n:check-sync` | ✅ |
| 5 | `yarn i18n:check-usage` | ✅ |
| 6 | `yarn typecheck` | ✅ |
| 7 | `yarn test` | ✅ |
| 8 | `yarn build:app` | ✅ |

Plus the docs-specific checks:

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `yarn build` (`apps/docs`, Docusaurus production build — validates every internal link and anchor) | ✅ pass |
| `node --test __tests__/search-index.test.mjs __tests__/reference-example-module.test.mjs` | ✅ 6/6 pass |

The build reports one broken anchor, `/installation/wsl2#connecting-wsl2-to-a-windows-hosted-database`.
It is **pre-existing** and untouched by this branch. Both docs commands were re-run after the review
fixes.

### Phase 5: Review pass (`om-auto-review-pr 5587 --autofix`)

- [x] 5.1 Authoritative review + autofix — a34d4c915, 05d0a7920, d61c59511

Verdict **approve**, no blockers. GitHub refuses self-approval, so the report was posted as a PR
comment; a maintainer other than the author still owes the formal approval.

One **major** and four **minor** findings, all fixed in this branch:

- **major — unreachable capabilities presented as working.** The guide claimed channel history,
  message edit and message delete work. None is reachable: `fetchHistory`'s only caller
  (`poll-channel.ts:128`) returns early for `realtimePush: true` channels, `poll-now` answers 409,
  `import-history` needs the unimplemented `importHistory()`, and `editMessage` / `deleteMessage`
  have **no hub call site at all, for any provider**. This is the same defect the spec was corrected
  for on 2026-08-24 when `threading` was demoted. Fixed in a34d4c915, which also gave the developer
  guide the general rule: the registry proves the method exists, not that anything calls it.
- **minor — wrong permission prerequisite.** Said admin access to Integrations; connecting is a
  profile-page action gated by `communication_channels.connect_user_channel`. Fixed in a34d4c915.
- **minor — invite permission integers.** Drafted from the spec's `67648` / `75840`; the correct OR
  of `VIEW_CHANNEL` (0x400) + `SEND_MESSAGES` (0x800) + `READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY` (0x10000) +
  `ADD_REACTIONS` (0x40) is **68672**, and **76864** with `MANAGE_MESSAGES` (0x2000). The spec is
  wrong. Fixed in 899828d13.
- **minor — "Test send" button.** No such control exists; `test-send` is API-only. Replaced with the
  real request and its body schema. Fixed in 899828d13.
- **minor — replay guard attributed to the wrong surface.** The freshness paragraph sat under the
  adapter's `verifyWebhook`, which has no replay guard — it lives on the interactions route. Fixed in
  d61c59511.

### Open finding for the code PR, not fixable here

`capabilities.conversationHistory: true` on the Discord adapter looks unreachable by the same test
that demoted `threading` to `false`: the flag's only consumer is the polling worker, which
`realtimePush: true` on the same object disables. Less harmful than the `threading` case (the method
exists, so registry parity holds and no work is silently dropped), but the same class of
over-declaration. Deserves a deliberate decision on #4391 — flip it to `false` with a reason, or keep
it and record why the unreachability is acceptable. Not in this diff, so documented rather than
fixed; these pages describe the observable behaviour truthfully either way.

Also worth correcting on the #4391 branch: the spec's § Invite the bot carries the wrong permission
integers, its Interactions Endpoint URL points at `/api/communication_channels/webhook/discord`
rather than the shipped `/api/channel_discord/interactions`, and it references a
`register-slash-commands` CLI command `cli.ts` does not define.

### Phase 6: Resume after #4391 merged (`om-auto-continue-pr 5587`)

Added on 2026-08-26. Phases 1–5 were all `- [x]`, but the PR was not finishable: it carried
`blocked` because `packages/channel-discord` was not yet on `develop`, and the re-review left two
follow-ups that could only be done once it was. [#4391](https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato/pull/4391)
merged as `f75c35b3d` on 2026-08-25, so both are now actionable.

- [x] 6.1 Merge `origin/develop` into the branch so the docs sit on the code they describe — 3d09ca07e
- [x] 6.2 Re-verify every code-anchored claim against #4391's **merged** head — ecdacb72b (the re-review's
      substantive follow-up: the previous pass verified against a moving branch)
- [x] 6.3 Run the `apps/docs` Docusaurus production build against this head — the re-review flagged
      that no build had been run since `b735d7882`, and nothing in CI covers `apps/docs`
- [x] 6.4 Refresh the PR description: the merge-ordering warning and the "#4663 / #4778 are out of
      scope" framing are both stale
- [x] 6.5 Flip the pipeline label from `blocked` to `merge-queue`

**Re-verification against merged `packages/channel-discord` (`f75c35b3d`).** Every code-anchored
claim on both pages was checked against the merged source, not against a branch snapshot:

| Claim | Source of truth | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Capability table (21 flags, `supportedBodyFormats`, `maxBodyLength: 2000`, `recipientFormat`) | `lib/capabilities.ts` | ✅ flag-for-flag |
| Three CLI commands and every flag (`start-gateway --tenant/--refresh` default 60; `configure-from-env --tenant/--org`; `register-slash-commands --tenant/--org/--guild/--commands`) | `cli.ts` | ✅ |
| Default slash command `/mercato` with a required `message` option; guild `PUT` replaces the list | `lib/slash-commands.ts`, `cli.ts` | ✅ |
| Interactions route `/api/channel_discord/interactions`, `requireAuth: false`, `rateLimit 120/60s`, defer-then-worker | `api/interactions/route.ts` | ✅ |
| ±300s replay window, screened before the signature fan-out | `lib/interactions-verify.ts` (`DISCORD_SIGNATURE_MAX_SKEW_SECONDS = 300`), `api/interactions/route.ts` | ✅ |
| AI auto-reply: default off, `channel_discord.ai_auto_reply.run`, three-way auto-send gate with a 0.6 floor, optional `ai_assistant` → no-op, object mode | `subscribers/ai-auto-reply.ts` (`AUTO_SEND_MIN_CONFIDENCE = 0.6`), `acl.ts` | ✅ |
| Eight `OM_CHANNEL_DISCORD_*` vars and their defaults | `lib/preset.ts`, `lib/discord-rest.ts` | ✅ |
| DI service names, integration manifest, connect widget spot + feature | `di.ts`, `integration.ts`, `widgets/injection-table.ts` | ✅ |
| Hub event ids and payload fields; `providerKey === 'discord'` | `communication_channels/events.ts`, `lib/adapter.ts` | ✅ |
| `test-send` request body `{ to, body }` | `communication_channels/api/post/channels/[id]/test-send/route.ts` | ✅ |
| Signed-route file path | `api/interactions/route.ts` | ❌ guide said `api/post/interactions/route.ts` — **fixed in ecdacb72b** |

**Docs gate, re-run against `ecdacb72b`** (runner **local**):

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `yarn build` (`apps/docs`, Docusaurus production build) | ✅ exit 0 |
| `node --test __tests__/search-index.test.mjs __tests__/reference-example-module.test.mjs` | ✅ exit 0 |

The one broken anchor the build reports, `/installation/wsl2#connecting-wsl2-to-a-windows-hosted-database`,
is pre-existing and untouched by this branch. The rest of `validation.commands` covers code surfaces
this branch does not touch — the diff against `develop` is eight files, seven `.mdx` plus
`apps/docs/sidebars.ts`, which the Docusaurus build loads and type-checks.

Status after this resume: **complete**. Pipeline label `merge-queue`; already approved by @pkarw and
carrying `skip-qa`.
