# PR Workflow — Labels, QA Gate, and Auto-Skill Protocol

The authoritative, long-form version of the PR label policy. The root `AGENTS.md` keeps only
the boundaries (which label groups exist, the hard merge blocks, the "exactly one priority +
exactly one risk" rule); everything below is the detail that used to live there. The machine
readable taxonomy lives in `.ai/agentic.config.json` (`labels.*`, `qaGate`).

## Label groups

- Pipeline labels are mutually exclusive: `review`, `changes-requested`, `qa`, `qa-failed`, `merge-queue`, `blocked`, `do-not-merge`.
- Category labels are additive: `bug`, `feature`, `refactor`, `security`, `dependencies`, `enterprise`, `documentation`.
- Meta labels are additive: `needs-qa`, `skip-qa`, `qa-approved`, `qa-self-verified`, `in-progress`, `ci-monitoring`, `screenshots`.
- Priority labels are mutually exclusive within their group (only one at a time): `priority-low`, `priority-medium`, `priority-high`, `priority-extreme`.
- Risk labels are mutually exclusive within their group (only one at a time): `risk-low`, `risk-medium`, `risk-high`.

## Priority

Priority labels are applied to issues and PRs to communicate urgency, are additive with
respect to category and meta labels, and default to **unset** (treated as `priority-medium`)
when no priority label is present. Use `priority-extreme` for production outages or security
incidents that require immediate action; `priority-high` for release-blocking issues;
`priority-low` for cosmetic, opportunistic, or follow-up cleanup work.

Treat priority as a first-class signal, not an afterthought. Every issue and every non-draft
PR SHOULD carry exactly one priority label; `om-auto-*` skills are expected to set or infer it
(see the inference rule below) rather than leave it unset. When a PR inherits from an issue,
copy the issue's priority forward unless the change in scope clearly warrants a different one.

**Priority inference** (used by auto-skills when no priority label is present): production
outage, data loss, or a security incident → `priority-extreme`; security hardening,
release-blocking regression, auth/session/tenant-scope/money/event-reliability fixes →
`priority-high`; ordinary bug fixes and net-new features → `priority-medium`; cosmetic,
docs-only, dependency bumps, opportunistic cleanup, or follow-up chores → `priority-low`. When
signals conflict, pick the higher priority and say why in the label comment.

## Risk

Risk labels communicate the **blast radius of the change** — how likely it is to introduce a
regression and how wide the impact would be if it does — and are additive with respect to
pipeline, category, meta, and priority labels. They default to **unset** (treated as
`risk-medium`) when no risk label is present. Risk is orthogonal to priority: priority is *how
urgent the work is*, risk is *how dangerous the change is to ship*. A one-line typo fix for a
production outage is `priority-extreme` + `risk-low`; a large auth-layer refactor that can wait
is `priority-low` + `risk-high`.

Treat risk as a first-class signal alongside priority. Every non-draft PR SHOULD carry exactly
one risk label; `om-auto-*` skills are expected to set or infer it rather than leave it unset.
When a PR inherits from an issue, copy the issue's risk forward unless the change in scope
clearly warrants a different one.

**Risk inference** (used by auto-skills when no risk label is present): changes to
auth/session/tenant-scope/money/billing, database migrations or schema, encryption, event
reliability, shared contract surfaces (types, signatures, event IDs, widget spot IDs, DI keys,
ACL IDs, API routes), or broad cross-module edits → `risk-high`; an ordinary single-module
feature or bug fix that ships with tests → `risk-medium`; docs-only, dependency bumps,
test-only, comment/typo, or isolated cosmetic cleanup → `risk-low`. When signals conflict, pick
the higher risk and say why in the label comment. A `risk-high` PR strengthens the case for
`needs-qa` and deeper review even when it would otherwise look routine.

## Pipeline transitions

- A ready non-draft PR should carry `review` unless it is already in another pipeline state.
- `auto-review-pr` MUST move approved PRs to `merge-queue`. For a PR that carries `needs-qa`
  (without `skip-qa`) it keeps `needs-qa` in place, so the QA-approval gate holds the actual
  merge until a QA reviewer adds `qa-approved`. Auto-skills MUST NOT set the `qa` pipeline
  label — see the `qa` rule below.
- `auto-review-pr` MUST move review failures to `changes-requested`.
- `qa` (pipeline) means **manual QA is in progress**: a QA reviewer has picked the PR up and is
  actively testing it. It is applied **manually by a QA reviewer**, never by an `om-auto-*`
  skill. Auto-skills request QA with the `needs-qa` meta label only; they never set, move to, or
  remove `qa`. A QA reviewer flips a queued `needs-qa` PR from `merge-queue` to `qa` while
  testing, then records the outcome with `qa-approved` (pass) or `qa-failed` (fail).

The `qa` pipeline label is driven manually by QA reviewers, not by auto-skills. When a QA
reviewer starts testing a queued `needs-qa` PR, they move it from `merge-queue` to `qa`
(`gh pr edit <number> --remove-label merge-queue --add-label qa`) to signal QA is in progress.
When QA passes, move it back and record approval (`gh pr edit <number> --remove-label qa
--add-label merge-queue --add-label qa-approved`); via the self-QA exception add
`qa-self-verified` as well. When QA fails, route to `qa-failed` (`gh pr edit <number>
--remove-label qa --add-label qa-failed`) and do not add `qa-approved`.

## QA meta labels and the merge gate

- `needs-qa` is for UI changes, new features, sales or order flows, and other customer-facing
  behavior that needs manual exercise. It presumes there is a surface a QA reviewer can actually
  exercise by hand; when there is not, see the automated-verification exemption below.
- `skip-qa` is for docs-only, dependency-only, CI-only, test-only, typo-only, changes with no
  manually exercisable surface (see the exemption below), or similarly low-risk
  non-customer-facing changes.
- **Automated-verification exemption (no manually exercisable surface):** a change that touches
  no UI-rendering file — no `.tsx` outside tests, nothing under `packages/ui/src/`, nothing under
  `**/components/**` — gives a QA reviewer nothing to click through, so manual exercise cannot
  produce evidence beyond what the test suite already proves. Such a PR takes `skip-qa` instead of
  `needs-qa`, **but only when it leaves the database structure and API surface unchanged, does not
  break any contract in `BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md`, and ships automated tests covering the
  changed behavior in the same PR**: unit tests at minimum, and an integration test whenever the
  change crosses component boundaries or touches auth, session, tenant scope, money, or event
  reliability. A PR that changes the database structure or API surface, breaks a
  backward-compatibility contract, or lacks the required coverage keeps `needs-qa`; the QA
  reviewer verifies a non-UI change through its applicable interface instead of the UI.
  Translation-only changes to `i18n/*.json` fall under the same exemption: they are verified by
  reading the diff plus `yarn i18n:check-sync` and `yarn i18n:check-usage`, which the validation
  gate already runs. This exemption replaces manual clicking that cannot happen with executable
  proof that runs on every push — it does not lower the bar, so `security` and `risk-high` neither
  qualify nor disqualify a PR for it. The risk-inference rule above still applies: a `risk-high`
  PR is a reason to demand the integration test and a deeper review, not a reason to demand
  clicking that cannot happen. A reviewer may always override the exemption back to `needs-qa`
  with a stated reason (for example when the change alters a response the UI renders). It does not
  touch the QA-approval merge gate below: a PR that carries `needs-qa` still MUST NOT merge
  without `qa-approved`.
- `qa-approved` records that manual QA passed for a `needs-qa` PR. It is the durable proof that
  gates the merge; the `merge-queue` pipeline label is the routing state, while `qa-approved` is
  the evidence that QA actually happened. Set both when QA passes.
- `screenshots` records that UI QA visual evidence was attached to the PR (posted by
  `om-auto-qa-pr`, which first runs `om-auto-review-pr` when the PR is still unreviewed); it is
  informational only — it does not gate merge and is orthogonal to `needs-qa`/`qa-approved`.

**QA-approval merge gate (hard rule): a PR that carries `needs-qa` MUST NOT be merged unless it
also carries `qa-approved`, even when every other check is green.** Moving such a PR to
`merge-queue` without `qa-approved` is not sufficient — the QA-approval gate blocks it. This is
a **label policy enforced by reviewers and the PR-automation tooling** (`om-merge-buddy`
classifies it as not-mergeable; `om-approve-merge-pr` and the auto-review/continue skills refuse
to merge it); there is no longer a dedicated `merge-gate` CI workflow, so the maintainer is
responsible for upholding it (optionally via a branch-protection rule that requires the
`qa-approved` label). `skip-qa` is the explicit opt-out: a PR with `skip-qa` does not require
`qa-approved`. Never combine `skip-qa` with `needs-qa`/`qa-approved`.

**Self-QA exception:** the manual QA is normally performed by the dedicated QA reviewers. When
they have no capacity to test in time, any engineer may self-QA instead — but only by
(1) checking the PR out and running it locally, (2) clicking through the affected flow, and
(3) attaching proof to the PR: a screenshot showing it working, or a written confirmation
describing what was exercised and the observed result. After that, apply BOTH `qa-approved` (so
the gate passes) and `qa-self-verified` (so it is auditable that a non-QA engineer signed off via
this exception, not the QA team). Do not apply `qa-approved` via the self-QA path without the
attached evidence. Refer to QA reviewers by role, never by GitHub handle — assignments change.

**Self-QA requires `triage` permission to finish.** Applying `qa-approved` + `qa-self-verified`
is a label write, so a contributor with `read` permission (the usual case for fork-based
contributions) can perform the testing and attach the evidence but cannot complete the exception.
For them it splits into two halves: the contributor posts the evidence comment on the PR — that
comment is the durable artifact, the labels only record it — and a maintainer applies the two
labels on the strength of it. A maintainer doing so is upholding the gate, not bypassing it, as
long as the linked evidence actually exists. Until the labels are on the PR it stays gated: an
attached evidence comment alone does not make a `needs-qa` PR merge-ready, and an `om-auto-*`
skill that cannot apply the labels MUST report that it stopped there rather than treat the
self-QA as complete.

`qa-failed` is a hard block: a PR carrying it MUST NOT merge until QA re-runs and it is cleared.
`do-not-merge` and `blocked` are likewise hard merge blocks. The QA-approval gate (reviewers +
PR-automation tooling) treats any of these as not-mergeable.

## Auto-skill protocol

- Auto-skills that mutate PRs or issues MUST claim them first with all three signals: assignee,
  `in-progress` label, and a claim comment. They MUST release the `in-progress` label when
  finished, even on failure.
- When an auto-skill adds or changes a PR pipeline/meta label, it MUST also leave a short PR
  comment explaining why that label was applied.

## `in-progress` vs `ci-monitoring`

These two meta labels describe **different phases** of an automated run and must never be
conflated. Both are meta labels: they are additive, they coexist with any pipeline label
(`review`, `changes-requested`, `merge-queue`, …) exactly like `needs-qa` does, and neither
participates in pipeline-label mutual exclusivity.

- **`in-progress` — a work claim (a lock).** The agent is actively working the PR: editing code,
  running the review, fixing findings, pushing commits. Its output is not yet on the PR. Other
  auto-skills back off while it is present. It is one of the three claim signals alongside the
  assignee and the claim comment.
- **`ci-monitoring` — a follow-up marker, NOT a claim.** The agent's work is **done and already
  fully reported**: pipeline labels applied, review submitted, comments posted. The only thing
  left is watching CI results and posting the CI-result follow-up comment. The PR's state on
  GitHub is already correct and complete without that comment.

**A PR carrying only `ci-monitoring` is explicitly NOT "already in progress".** In-progress /
concurrency detection MUST consider only the claim signals — the `in-progress` label, a non-self
assignee, and a fresh claim comment. When none of those are present, a PR is free to claim and
act on **even though `ci-monitoring` is on it**; another agent or a human may pick it up without
waiting, and doing so is not a claim violation. Do not lump `ci-monitoring` in with the lock
signals in any skip/back-off condition.

**Lifecycle.** An agent claims with `in-progress`. The moment its work is complete and reported,
it swaps the labels: remove `in-progress`, add `ci-monitoring`. When it posts the CI-result
follow-up comment, it removes `ci-monitoring` — the label's whole meaning is "a CI-result comment
is still owed on this PR". A skill that performs no CI follow-up simply removes `in-progress` as
it always has and never adds `ci-monitoring`.

**Why the split exists.** CI here runs for 20+ minutes to several hours (ephemeral integration
shards). Skills used to hold the review, the labels and the comments back until CI went green,
keeping `in-progress` applied the whole time. If that monitoring process died mid-wait, the PR was
stranded: it still looked claimed by a live agent that no longer existed, so other automation kept
skipping it — with no labels, no review, and no record that any work had happened at all. Reporting
immediately and switching to `ci-monitoring` makes the stranded case honest and self-describing:
the worst outcome is a missing CI-result comment on an otherwise fully processed PR that anyone
is free to take over.

`ci-monitoring` gates nothing. It does not affect the QA-approval merge gate, the priority/risk
requirements, or any hard merge block.

## Design-system governance files

The CODEOWNERS design-system section (`.github/CODEOWNERS`) assigns a single design owner to the
files that encode *how* the design system is governed — the rules, tokens, lint-escalation policy,
guardian skill and docs — as opposed to the UI code those files judge. At time of writing:
`docs/design-system/`, `.ai/ds-rules.md`, `.ai/ui-components.md`, `.ai/skills/om-ds-guardian/`,
`.ai/scripts/ds-health-check.sh`, `packages/eslint-plugin-ds/`, `.ai/ds/`, and both `globals.css`
files. Read CODEOWNERS for the current list rather than trusting this one.

**An automated PR MUST NOT change these files.** File an issue for the design owner instead. A
coding agent cannot weigh a governance trade-off the owner exists to make, and a CODEOWNERS review
request on a bot-authored diff puts that owner in the position of rubber-stamping or re-deriving
the reasoning from scratch.

**UI code and modules stay open.** The restriction is deliberately narrow: it covers the governance
surface, not the components, pages, or module code that the design system applies to. An automated
PR that changes a component while respecting `.ai/ds-rules.md` is doing exactly what it should.
