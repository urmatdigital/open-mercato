# Shared security-default changes require a complete consumer audit

**Context**: Hardening the shared rate-limit proxy-depth default fixed auth and metadata-driven consumers, but checkout public routes still passed a hard-coded trust depth of `1`.

**Problem**: A secure shared default has no effect when a downstream consumer overrides it. Direct checkout deployments could still trust attacker-controlled forwarding headers and rotate rate-limit buckets.

**Rule**: When changing a shared security default, enumerate every production call site and remove local overrides that bypass the contract. Centralize repeated key derivation in the owning module and add tests for direct, one-proxy, multi-proxy, and fallback behavior.

**Applies to**: shared auth, rate-limit, origin, session, encryption, and tenant-scoping helpers and every module that consumes them.

- 2026-08-11 · events/example: options-only SSE scope hardening would have dropped 53 of 62 current browser event types → use an explicit trusted-scope marker and audit every `clientBroadcast` producer before changing the legacy fallback.

- 2026-08-12 · example_customers_sync: a positive security-control fixture omitted fields required by the downstream sync contract, so it could not prove the guarded delete sink was reachable → make legitimate controls satisfy every downstream invariant before contrasting them with rejected probes.

- 2026-07-09 · customer_accounts: organization-scoped RBAC queries can still trust pre-hardening ACL caches → version the cache-key namespace when authorization semantics change
- 2026-07-10 · payment_gateways: a stale-claim lease without owner heartbeats can steal slow live provider calls; renew token-scoped leases during provider I/O and let followers wait for the shared result.

- 2026-07-09 · customer_accounts: denial tests covered status but missed secondary side effects and complete same-org parity → assert every write/event/cache path stays untouched and exercise all affected positive routes
