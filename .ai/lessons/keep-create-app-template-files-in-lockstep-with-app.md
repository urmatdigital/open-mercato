# Keep create-app template files in lockstep with app shell/layout changes

**Context**: Core app layout behavior was updated in `apps/mercato/src/app/(backend)/backend/layout.tsx`, but equivalent files in `packages/create-app/template/src/app/` were not updated in the same change.

**Problem**: Newly scaffolded apps diverged from monorepo defaults (missing newer navigation/profile/settings wiring and behavior fixes), causing inconsistent UX and harder debugging.

**Rule**: Any change to shared bootstrap/layout shell behavior in `apps/mercato/src/app/**` must include a sync review and required updates in matching `packages/create-app/template/src/app/**` and dependent template components.

**Applies to**: Root layout, backend layout, global providers, header/sidebar wiring, and related template-only wrapper components.
