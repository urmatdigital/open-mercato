# Store global event bus in `globalThis` to survive module duplication in dev

**Context**: `record_locks` notifications stopped while banners still worked. Banner logic uses direct API polling, but notifications depend on `emitRecordLocksEvent()` from `createModuleEvents()` and the global event bus wiring.

**Problem**: In dev (HMR/Turbopack), duplicated module instances can appear. One instance receives `setGlobalEventBus()` during bootstrap, another instance emits events. With module-local singleton only, emitted events can be dropped silently.

**Rule**: For process-wide runtime singletons used across package boundaries (event bus, similar registries), keep canonical reference in `globalThis` and use module-local variable only as fallback.

**Applies to**: `packages/shared/src/modules/events/factory.ts` and any shared runtime singleton relied on by module auto-discovery/subscriber pipelines.
