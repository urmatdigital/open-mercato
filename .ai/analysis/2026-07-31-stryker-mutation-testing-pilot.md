# StrykerJS pilot (Phase 0) — measured feasibility on `packages/shared`

Date: 2026-07-31 · Branch: `chore/stryker-pilot` · Machine: local dev box, `concurrency: 4`

Goal: decide whether diff-scoped mutation testing can run in CI without pushing the pipeline
into hours, and surface every monorepo-specific blocker before a spec is written.

## Verdict

Feasible for `packages/shared` at PR-diff scale (**44 s – 1 min 25 s** per run). Four blockers were
hit and three are worked around; one (`coverageAnalysis`) is unresolved and constrains the design.

## Setup

- `@stryker-mutator/core` + `@stryker-mutator/jest-runner` as devDependencies of `packages/shared`
- `packages/shared/stryker.conf.json`, `testRunner: jest`, `jest.projectType: custom`,
  `jest.configFile: jest.config.cjs`
- `mutator.excludedMutations: ["StringLiteral", "Regex"]`
- `thresholds.break: 70`

## Blockers found

### 1. TypeScript 7 breaks Stryker's tsconfig preprocessor — BLOCKER, worked around

```
TypeError: ts.parseConfigFileTextToJson is not a function
  at TSConfigPreprocessor.rewriteTSConfigFile
```

The repo runs `typescript@7.0.2` (Go compiler, no JS compiler API) with `typescript-js`
(`npm:typescript@6.0.3`) as the JS-API alias — see `scripts/jest-typescript-resolver.cjs`.
Stryker's sandbox preprocessor does a bare `await import('typescript')` and dies.

Workarounds: (a) `inPlace: true` short-circuits the preprocessor entirely, (b) point
`tsconfigFile` at a non-existent path so the rewrite is skipped. The pilot uses (a),
which also solves blocker 2.

### 2. Sandbox copy breaks every relative path in the jest config — BLOCKER, worked around

Stryker copies the package into `packages/shared/.stryker-tmp/sandbox-XXXX/`, one level deeper
than the real package, so `require('../../jest.config.base.cjs')` and the transformer path
`<rootDir>/../../scripts/jest-mikroorm-transformer.cjs` both resolve outside the sandbox:

```
Cannot find module '../../jest.config.base.cjs'
```

Every package in this monorepo shares that pattern, so this would hit all ~20 of them.
`inPlace: true` removes the sandbox and fixes it. Cost: Stryker mutates real source files during
the run and restores them from `.stryker-tmp/backup-XXXX` afterwards — verified clean
(`git status` clean after every run, including after a crashed run). A killed process
(`SIGKILL`, runner eviction) can leave mutated sources behind; recovery is `git checkout`.

### 3. `@jest-environment` docblocks block coverage analysis — UNRESOLVED

`coverageAnalysis: "perTest"` and `"all"` both fail the dry run:

```
Missing coverage results for:
  * src/modules/widgets/__tests__/injection-loader.required-modules.test.ts
  * src/lib/bootstrap/__tests__/dynamicLoader.cacheRecovery.test.ts
  (and 4 more)
```

Stryker needs its own jest environment (`@stryker-mutator/jest-runner/jest-env/node`) to report
coverage. Setting it via `jest.config.testEnvironment` does not help, because these files declare
`@jest-environment node|jsdom` in a docblock, which always wins. `packages/shared` has 10+ such
files; the pattern is used repo-wide.

The pilot therefore runs `coverageAnalysis: "off"`: no coverage-driven test selection, only
jest's `--findRelatedTests`. This is the single biggest performance lever left on the table.

Options for the spec: drop the docblocks where they only restate the config default (most of the
`@jest-environment node` ones do), or ship a `mixinJestEnvironment` wrapper module and point the
docblocks at it.

### 4. Diff-based selection must be hand-rolled — by design

StrykerJS has no `--since` flag (only `--incremental` + `--incrementalFile` + `--force`, which
diff internally, not against a git branch). Diff scoping = compute the file list ourselves from
`git diff --name-only origin/<base>...HEAD`, filter to the domain layer, pass as `--mutate`.

## Measurements

| Target | LOC | Scored mutants | Wall time | Score | Tests run per mutant |
|--------|-----|----------------|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| `src/lib/boolean.ts` | 28 | 30 | **1 m 18 s** | 93.3 % | 530 |
| `featureMatch.ts` + `phone.ts` + `number.ts` | 134 | 119 | **44 s** | 78.2 % | 68 |
| `src/lib/crud/optimistic-lock.ts` | 396 | 200 | **1 m 25 s** | 74.5 % | 127 |

Baseline for comparison: a single jest test file in this package runs in ~4 s; the full
`packages/shared` suite is 140 test files.

**The cost driver is fan-in, not mutant count.** A 28-line file that half the package imports
(`boolean.ts`) is slower than a 396-line leaf file, because `--findRelatedTests` pulls in 530
tests per mutant instead of 127. Any per-PR budget must be expressed in "tests per mutant",
not "lines changed".

## Score findings (substantive, not tooling)

Every survivor below was traced back to the source and the test file before being classified. The
three files produced three *different* kinds of survivor, which is the most useful result of the
pilot.

**1. Genuine test gap — `phone.ts`, 57.1 %.** `validatePhoneNumber` rejects input for four reasons
(`invalid_characters`, `invalid_plus_sign`, `too_short`, `too_long`) and for each one the
`BooleanLiteral` mutant flipping `valid: false` → `valid: true` survives, as do the boundary
mutants `digits.length < PHONE_MIN_DIGITS` → `<=` and `> PHONE_MAX_DIGITS` → `>=`. Verified cause:
`src/lib/__tests__/phone.test.ts` contains three tests — empty string, one valid number, one
missing country code. No other real coverage exists; `packages/ui`'s `PhoneNumberField.test.tsx`
mocks the helper. The function could accept every malformed number and the suite would pass.

**2. Equivalent mutants — `boolean.ts`, 93.3 %.** Both survivors are unkillable, not untested.
Removing `if (!trimmed) return null` changes no behaviour: an empty string is in neither
`TRUE_VALUES` nor `FALSE_VALUES`, so control falls through to the same `return null`. Same for
`if (typeof value === 'string')` in `parseBooleanFromUnknown` — the inner `parseBooleanToken`
re-checks the type. `boolean.test.ts` does assert `parseBooleanToken('')`, `('   ')`, `(null)` and
`parseBooleanFromUnknown(1)`. A gate that demanded these be killed would be demanding noise.

**3. Redundant source paths — `optimistic-lock.ts`, 74.5 %.** The `mode: 'off'` survivors
(`if (config.mode === 'off') return false` → `return true`, and the surrounding block) are not an
untested path: `optimistic-lock.test.ts` covers `envValue: 'off'` explicitly. They survive because
the same condition is checked twice — once in `isEntityEnabled`, once in the caller — so each
check masks mutation of the other. Actionable, but as a duplication finding, not a coverage one.

**Consequence for the design.** Only one of the three headline scores means "write more tests".
A mutation gate must therefore produce a triage list for a human, ship advisory-first, and offer a
first-class way to mark an equivalent mutant (`// Stryker disable next-line <mutator>` with a
justification) instead of pressuring anyone to weaken the threshold.

Survivor distribution on `optimistic-lock.ts` (200 mutants):

| Mutator | Total | Survived |
|---------|-------|----------|
| ConditionalExpression | 71 | 23 |
| BlockStatement | 23 | 9 |
| ObjectLiteral | 26 | 6 |
| LogicalOperator | 15 | 4 |
| EqualityOperator | 27 | 3 |
| MethodExpression | 8 | 3 |
| BooleanLiteral | 25 | 3 |
| StringLiteral | 34 | 0 (excluded → Ignored) |

`StringLiteral` exclusion works as intended — 34 mutants ignored, no effect on the score. In this
repo those literals are event IDs (`module.entity.action`), i18n keys and ACL feature IDs; mutating
them would have produced exactly the brittle string-assertion tests the initiative wants to avoid.

## Implications for the design

1. `inPlace: true` is mandatory in this monorepo — the sandbox cannot survive the shared jest
   config. That makes CI (ephemeral runners) the natural home and makes local runs a
   "commit first" operation.
2. Per-package Stryker config + a CI matrix over changed packages. One root config cannot work:
   each package has its own `rootDir`, `moduleNameMapper` and transformer.
3. `packages/shared` numbers do **not** transfer to `packages/core` (bigger suites, 30 s test
   timeouts, DI/ORM bootstrapping). A second measurement on `core` belongs in the spec before
   the gate is turned on there.
4. A minimum-mutant floor is needed before any break threshold is enforced — at 4 mutants one
   survivor is 75 %.
5. `phone.ts` at 57 % shows the gate cannot be switched on retroactively for whole files. It must
   score **only the changed lines/files of the PR**, and land advisory-first.

# Phase 0b — measured feasibility on `packages/core` (2026-08-04)

## Verdict

**`packages/core` stays out of the Phase 1 allowlist.** It misses the spec's exit criterion — "a
run on 3 representative `core` business-logic files completes under 10 min" — not marginally but by
roughly two orders of magnitude. `packages/shared` ships alone.

## Setup

Identical to the Phase 0 pilot, via a throwaway `packages/core/stryker.conf.mjs` mirroring the
pilot config (not committed — the deliverable of this phase is the measurement). One adaptation was
required: `timeoutMS` raised from 30 s to 60 s, because `packages/core/jest.config.cjs` sets
`testTimeout: 30000` and the pilot's 30 s Stryker timeout would report timeouts instead of scores.

Three representative business-logic files were chosen, one per the layer the spec named, each with
real existing test coverage so the numbers reflect genuine fan-in rather than an empty suite.

## Measurements

| Target | Layer | LOC | Mutants | Wall time | Score | Tests per mutant |
|--------|-------|-----|---------|-----------|-------|------------------|
| `src/modules/auth/lib/rateLimitCheck.ts` | `lib/` | 75 | 41 | **1 m 45 s** | 58.5 % | 92.7 |
| `src/modules/auth/commands/roles.ts` | `commands/` | 657 | — | **> 10 min, never completed** | — | — |
| `src/modules/customers/data/validators.ts` | `data/validators.ts` | 783 | 403 | **~6 h 42 m (Stryker's own ETA)** | — | — |

Only the leaf `lib/` file completed. `roles.ts` was run twice and exceeded ten minutes both times
without producing a score. `validators.ts` was aborted after Stryker generated 403 mutants and
projected 6 h 42 m remaining — the projection, not a guess, is the measurement.

The Phase 0 conclusion holds and sharpens: **the cost driver is fan-in, not file size.** A 75-line
`core` leaf file costs 1 m 45 s against 92.7 tests per mutant, while `shared`'s 396-line leaf file
cost 1 m 25 s. What breaks `core` is that its command and validator layers sit under large,
DI/ORM-bootstrapping suites, so `--findRelatedTests` pulls in an order of magnitude more work per
mutant.

## Score finding

`rateLimitCheck.ts` scored **58.5 %** (24 killed / 17 survived of 41). Survivors cluster on the
early-return guards — `if (!rateLimiterService) return { error: null, compoundKey: null }` survives
being forced to `if (false)`, and the compound-key branch survives `&&` becoming `||`. That is the
same class of gap the Phase 0 pilot found in `phone.ts`: the tests exercise the happy path and
assert the returned shape, but never assert that a *specific* guard is what rejected the request.
The finding is real and worth a follow-up issue — but it is a reason to write tests, not a reason
to enable the gate on a package that cannot finish a run.

## Operational finding: an interrupted `inPlace` run is expensive to recover

This was measured accidentally and matters more than the timings for anyone running locally.

Stryker's `disableTypeChecks` defaults to on, so before mutating it prepends `// @ts-nocheck` to
every file matching its instrumentation globs. With `inPlace: true` those writes land on real
source files. When a run was killed mid-flight, it left **4 966 modified files** in
`packages/core` — every one of them carrying an injected `// @ts-nocheck`.

Recovery was complete and immediate with `git checkout -- packages/core`, exactly the command the
spec requires the wrapper to print. Two conclusions:

1. The clean-tree guard in `yarn mutation:changed` is not a nicety, it is the only thing standing
   between an interrupted run and 5 000 unreviewable modifications mixed into a developer's work.
   It is implemented as a hard stop, never a warning.
2. `disableTypeChecks` cannot simply be turned off to shrink the blast radius: this repository's
   jest transformer is ts-jest based and type-checks, so mutants that break types would surface as
   errors instead of being scored. The default stays, and the guard carries the risk.

A cleanly finishing run restores its own files correctly, including after a `SIGTERM` — that was
verified separately and matches the Phase 0 finding.

## Implications for the design

1. **The Phase 1 allowlist is `['shared']`.** `packages/core` is excluded in `scripts/stryker/scope.mjs`
   and adding it later requires a fresh measurement, not a judgement call.
2. `createConfig.mjs` still carries a per-package `timeoutMS` override (`core: 60000`) because the
   value is a property of the package's jest config, not of its allowlist status. It documents why
   the knob exists if `core` is ever revisited.
3. Revisiting `core` is not hopeless, but it needs a different lever than a bigger timeout — the
   `coverageAnalysis: "perTest"` work deferred to Phase 4, or scoping mutation to changed *lines*
   rather than changed *files*. Neither is in scope for this change.

# Phase 4 — optimisation assessed and declined (2026-08-04)

Phase 4 is conditional in the spec: *"Only if Phase 1–3 timings demand it."* Both steps were
attempted rather than assumed. Neither ships.

## The timing budget that decides it

Measured on the shipped scope (`packages/shared`, the only allowlisted package):

| Segment | Time |
|---------|------|
| `yarn install --immutable` (warm Yarn cache) | ~16 s |
| `yarn build:packages` | ~55 s |
| Mutation run — `boolean.ts`, the pilot's worst fan-in case (615.92 tests/mutant) | 1 m 27 s |
| **Total job** | **~3 min** |
| Workflow budget (`timeout-minutes`) | **20 min** |

The job uses about 15 % of its budget on the worst single-file case the pilot identified. There is
no timing pressure for either optimisation to relieve.

## Step 1 — `perTest` coverage is blocked, not merely unnecessary

`--coverageAnalysis perTest` fails `packages/shared` in the initial test run. 19 of its suites carry
`@jest-environment` docblocks (792 repo-wide), which is the blocker Q3 anticipated.

Stryker ships the wrapped environments this needs (`@stryker-mutator/jest-runner/jest-env/node` and
`.../jest-env/jsdom`), and those match the only two values the docblocks use here (`node`, `jsdom`).
So the natural fix is to redirect the docblocks' resolution rather than edit them. **That was tried
and does not work:** a Jest `moduleNameMapper` mapping `jest-environment-node` and
`jest-environment-jsdom` onto the Stryker wrappers has no effect, because Jest resolves the
`@jest-environment` docblock outside the `moduleNameMapper` path.

What remains is editing 19 test files (Q3 forbids it) or replacing the repo-wide Jest `resolver` in
`jest.config.base.cjs` — which would place every suite in the repository behind a change made for a
mutation-testing optimisation that the timings do not need.

## Step 2 — `incremental` caching is declined on risk, not just need

`incremental: true` reuses Stryker's previous report to skip re-testing unchanged mutants. Two
reasons not to ship it here:

- **No time to win.** The mutation step is 1 m 27 s of a ~3 min job. Even a perfect cache hit leaves
  the install and build, and the job still ends far inside its 20-minute budget.
- **A stale incremental file reports mutants as killed that current tests do not kill.** That is a
  false green in the one check whose entire value is trustworthy signal. Trading correctness risk
  for time nobody needs is a bad exchange, and the cache-key discipline needed to avoid it is real
  ongoing maintenance.

## When to revisit

When a package with materially larger suites joins the allowlist — which today means solving the
`packages/core` problem measured in Phase 0b — or when the Phase 1–2 advisory runs show real PRs
approaching the 20-minute timeout. At that point `perTest` via a Jest `resolver` change is the
higher-leverage of the two and becomes worth its blast radius.
