# Standalone-harness audit: module-fact coverage and case budgets

Issue: [#4565](https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato/issues/4565). Measured on the stacked head of
[#4556](https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato/pull/4556), itself stacked on
[#4529](https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato/pull/4529).

Everything below is measured, not estimated. The measurement surface is a real scaffolded controller —
an empty directory holding the template's `src/modules.ts`, populated with `mercato agentic:init` — so the
fact-sheet set, the guide sizes, and the skill tree are exactly what a scaffolded app receives.

```
node packages/cli/dist/bin.js agentic:init --tool claude-code   # in an empty app root
node scripts/evaluate-agent-harness.mjs --root <root> --all      # deterministic gate
```

Environment: macOS 26.5.2 (arm64), Node 24.14.1, `claude` 2.1.220 on the `sonnet` selector.

### Case numbering: this report predates the renumbering

Every measurement below was taken while this work's cases were numbered `OMH-188`…`OMH-195`. Merging
#4529's head on 2026-07-30 showed the parent had independently claimed `OMH-188`…`OMH-192` for writable
cases of its own, so these cases first moved to `OMH-193`…`OMH-201`. PR #4759 then claimed `OMH-193`
on `develop`, so the final merge result shifts this work once more to `OMH-194`…`OMH-202` — byte-identical apart from the ID
and the `relatedCases` repointed with them. Case IDs in the sections below are the **shipped** ones, so
they can be looked up in `cases.json` directly; where a measurement is quoted, it was produced by the same
case under its earlier ID. The mapping is:

| Measured as | Ships as | Fact-sheet |
|---|---|---|
| OMH-188 | **OMH-194** | `dictionaries` |
| OMH-189 | **OMH-195** | `api_keys` |
| OMH-190 | **OMH-196** | `configs` |
| OMH-191 | **OMH-197** | `perspectives` |
| OMH-192 | **OMH-198** | `resources` |
| OMH-193 | **OMH-199** | `sync_excel` |
| OMH-194 | **OMH-200** | `gateway_stripe` |
| OMH-195 | **OMH-201** | `sync_akeneo` |
| — (added later) | **OMH-202** | `wms` |

## 1. Module-fact coverage

At audit time a scaffold shipped **47** fact-sheets: the intersection of the 53 the build generated with
the 47 modules the template statically enabled. Merging #4529 enabled `wms` in the template, so the
current figure is **48 of 54** — a transition this branch's own guards caught rather than a drift that
slipped through (§1.2). The six generated-but-not-shipped sheets are unchanged: `core`, `generators`,
`widgets`, and the enterprise/opt-in modules (`record_locks`, `security`, `sso`,
`system_status_overlays`, `storage_s3`) that the template only enables behind an environment flag.

### 1.1 Before this branch

Six shipped fact-sheets had **no trace anywhere in the catalog** — not in a case's `context.required` or
`context.allowedExtra`, not as an `owner.path`, not in any title, prompt, or tag:

| Module | Capability an agent would otherwise rebuild |
|---|---|
| `configs` | per-organization runtime module settings (`module_configs`, `configs.manage`) |
| `perspectives` | saved list views plus role defaults (`perspectives`, `role_perspectives`) |
| `resources` | shared-asset records with types, tags, comments, activity, search |
| `sync_excel` | operator-run spreadsheet upload and load (`sync_excel_uploads`) |
| `gateway_stripe` | the installed Stripe payment provider package |
| `sync_akeneo` | the installed Akeneo PIM connector package |

The reviewer's original list on #4529 named ten; `api_docs`, `inbox_ops`, and `planner` gained
`allowedExtra` references while #4529 progressed, and `api_keys`/`dictionaries` were covered by #4556.

### 1.2 After this branch

All 48 shipped fact-sheets are routed by at least one case. Nine cases now own a fact-sheet
(`owner.kind: "facts"`): OMH-194 `dictionaries`, OMH-195 `api_keys`, OMH-196 `configs`,
OMH-197 `perspectives`, OMH-198 `resources`, OMH-199 `sync_excel`, OMH-200 `gateway_stripe`,
OMH-201 `sync_akeneo`, OMH-202 `wms`.

`packages/create-app/src/lib/module-facts-build.test.ts` now fails when a scaffold ships a fact-sheet no
case routes. It uses the production `selectModuleFactSheets` intersection, so enabling a module in the
template without adding a case is a red test rather than a silent coverage hole.

That guard has already paid for itself once on this branch. Merging `develop` enabled `wms` in the
template, and both of this branch's guards fired on the merge result exactly as designed — the fact-index
canary on the 47 → 48 sheet count, and the coverage guard on `wms` having no case. OMH-202 closed the gap
the same way the eight cases above closed theirs, routing `.ai/guides/modules/wms.md` through `om-help` as
a reuse-installed architecture decision. OMH-202 was added after the live cohort in §3 had been run, so it
carries deterministic-gate and semantic-assertion coverage only; no live routing run is claimed for it
here.

### 1.3 The weaker tier this branch does not close

Eleven shipped fact-sheets are referenced **only** through `context.allowedExtra`: `api_docs`,
`audit_logs`, `business_rules`, `dashboards`, `directory`, `entities`, `inbox_ops`, `messages`,
`onboarding`, `planner`, `translations`. An `allowedExtra` reference permits a read; it never fails a run
that skips it. These capabilities are therefore visible to the catalog but not asserted by it. That is a
different, larger piece of work — a case per capability with a prompt that genuinely forces the read — and
it is handed to a follow-up rather than grown into this branch.

### 1.4 How that tier was closed (added 2026-08-06)

[#4603](https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato/issues/4603) closed it. Re-measuring the predicate
against the *shipped* set rather than against the eleven names above found a twelfth sheet with the same
defect, `design_system`, which post-dates this audit. Ten of the twelve received a routing case with the
sheet in `context.required` — OMH-204 `audit_logs`, OMH-205 `business_rules`, OMH-206 `dashboards`,
OMH-207 `directory`, OMH-208 `entities`, OMH-209 `inbox_ops`, OMH-210 `messages`, OMH-211 `onboarding`,
OMH-212 `planner`, OMH-213 `translations` — taking the catalog from 203 to 213 cases.

`api_docs` and `design_system` were exempted with reasons rather than covered: neither ships a `data/`
directory, an entity, or a migration (`api_docs` exports an empty `features` array; `design_system` has
one view-only feature), so there is no schema an agent could duplicate and the `facts-first` /
`tenant-scope` / `acl-features` decisions have nothing to bind to. Both stay reachable through their
existing `allowedExtra` references.

The `module-facts-build` guard §1.2 describes was tightened from "routed by some case" to "required by
some case", carrying those two exemptions in a list that is itself asserted — an exemption must still be
shipped and still be routed, so it cannot rot into a hidden coverage hole.

Unlike the OMH-194…OMH-202 cohort, whose uniform 11 / 57 344 / 147 456 envelope §3.2 calls "generous
rather than tight", the new cases carry budgets derived from each one's own measured footprint on an
emitted controller (6–8 files, 36 864–53 248 initial bytes, 61 440–118 784 total bytes).

## 2. Case-budget audit

Three budgets are case-local: `maxContextFiles`, `maxInitialContextBytes`, `maxTotalContextBytes`.
`timeoutMs` is case-local but writable-only. The refused-read ceiling is global
(`MAX_REFUSED_CONTEXT_READS = 6`), not per case.

The evaluator counts a path toward the *initial* budgets unless it lives under `/references/`,
`.ai/framework-context/`, `.ai/guides/modules/`, `.ai/guides/upstream/`, or `.agents/skills/`. So the honest floor for a case is the
on-disk size of its own `context.required`, restricted to initial paths — a number the catalog never
checked before this branch.

### 2.1 Cases their own budgets could not satisfy

| Case | Defect | Measured | Budget |
|---|---|---|---|
| OMH-169 | required initial context exceeds the byte budget | 57 372 B over 10 files | 57 344 B |

Merging current `develop` re-ran this same measurement against the enlarged instruction tree and found
one additional contradiction: OMH-120's required initial context is now 58 056 B against 57 344 B.
| OMH-146 | `maxContextFiles` equals the required set, and an `allowedExtra` initial path is declared that can never be opened | 4 required + 1 extra initial file | 4 files |
| OMH-111 | required plus all five declared extras exceed the byte budget and saturate the file budget | 57 845 B over 10 files | 57 344 B / 10 files |

OMH-169 is a guaranteed false negative: an agent that reads exactly the ten files the case demands and
nothing else is failed by 28 bytes. This is not a hypothesis — see §3.

### 2.2 Remediation

Widened from the measured footprints, rounded to the 4 KiB grid, smallest change that leaves real slack:

| Case | `maxContextFiles` | `maxInitialContextBytes` |
|---|---|---|
| OMH-111 | 10 → 11 | 57 344 → 65 536 |
| OMH-146 | 4 → 6 | 32 768 → 40 960 |
| OMH-169 | 11 (unchanged — 10 initial files fit) | 57 344 → 61 440 |
| OMH-120 | 10 (unchanged — 9 initial files fit) | 57 344 → 61 440 |

The OMH-169 row records what shipped, not what this audit first proposed. Upstream acted on the finding
directly, adopting 61 440 B in `296c4eed` ("test(harness): fit audited routing context") on the day this
audit was written, so the case arrives here already satisfiable and this branch changes only OMH-111 and
OMH-146. Its file budget never needed widening either: `.ai/guides/modules/customers.md` is non-initial,
so the case counts ten initial files against a budget of eleven.

`maxTotalContextBytes` was already generous everywhere: the smallest measured total-byte headroom across
the catalog is 37 985 B, so no total budget was touched.

Global limits are unchanged: `catalog.maxContextFiles` 16, `catalog.maxInitialContextBytes` 90 112,
`catalog.maxTotalContextBytes` 262 144, `MAX_REFUSED_CONTEXT_READS` 6, and every write, oracle, and
review limit.

### 2.3 The gate that keeps it measured

`validateCatalog` now measures each case's `context.required` and `context.required ∪ context.allowedExtra`
on disk and fails the deterministic gate when either cannot fit the case's own file or byte budgets. A
guide or fact-sheet that grows past a case's envelope therefore surfaces as a catalog error naming the
exact numbers, instead of as a live routing failure that reads like a model mistake.

One measurement boundary is worth stating: `.ai/guides/modules/*.md` is generated after enabled-module
discovery, so a tree where those sheets do not exist yet — a staged unit-test fixture, or a scaffold before
its first `generate` — measures them as zero bytes. They never count toward the *initial* budgets by design,
so only the total-byte arm is affected, and it is exact from the moment the sheets are on disk. The
controller measurements below include them.

Restoring OMH-169's pre-fix byte budget (`maxInitialContextBytes: 57344`) on an emitted controller and
re-running `--all` reproduces, verbatim:

```
FAIL OMH-169: required context exceeds maxInitialContextBytes: 60548/57344
Deterministic: 200/201 selected cases passed
```

The historical 200/201 output above was captured before PR #4759 added a case on `develop`; the final
merged catalog contains 202 cases. The gate reports one message per budget, not two: `validateCatalog`
tests the required set first and only
falls through to the declared set when the required set fits, so a required-context failure never prints a
declared-context line for the same budget. OMH-169 declares no `allowedExtra`, so its required and declared
sets are identical anyway. The 60 548 B is the required-context measurement at the head this PR ships —
higher than the 57 372 B measured when the budget was first widened, because the routed guides this case
requires have grown since; the counted case total was 201 because this PR added nine cases before
#4759's independently added case reached `develop`.

### 2.4 Budgets that are thin but not broken

Twenty-eight cases leave one spare initial file over their declared context, and two (OMH-028, OMH-180)
leave none. Seven leave under 4 KiB of initial-byte slack, the tightest being OMH-077 at 1 751 B. These
are satisfiable — an agent that reads exactly the declared set passes — so they are reported rather than
widened. Widening them without a clean successful trace for each would be exactly the "copy an envelope
from a simpler case" mistake the issue asks to avoid. §3 records the live outcome for the sampled subset.

### 2.5 Duration and refused-read budgets

Routing cases have **no** case-local duration budget. `timeoutMs` is rejected by catalog validation unless
the case is writable, so every routing case runs under the operator default of 300 000 ms and the only
lever is `--timeout`. Across the sampled live cohort the passing runs took 71 s to 231 s; the slowest
passing case (now OMH-196) therefore used **77%** of the ceiling, and one case (OMH-139) exhausted it entirely.
That is real but thin headroom on a contract the catalog cannot express, so it is reported rather than
changed here: a single timeout is model variance until it reproduces, and widening the routing timeout
contract deserves its own justification.

Refused reads peaked at **4** against the global ceiling of 6 (OMH-139); every other trace stayed at 0–2.
`MAX_REFUSED_CONTEXT_READS` is a global safety limit and is left alone.

## 3. Live evidence

Claude runner 2.1.220 on the `sonnet` selector, one fresh sandboxed process per case, run sequentially so
the durations are comparable.

### 3.1 The budget false negative, before and after

| | Violations | Initial bytes |
|---|---|---|
| OMH-169 before | `missing context BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md`, `required context not observed BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md`, **`initial context byte budget exceeded: 57372/57344`** | 57 372 / 57 344 |
| OMH-169 after | `missing context BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md`, `required context not observed BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md` | 57 372 / 65 536 |

The agent read exactly the ten initial files the case requires, in both runs, and the byte violation is
gone. **The case still fails**, on a different and pre-existing problem: the model never opens
`.ai/guides/upstream/BACKWARD_COMPATIBILITY.md`, a non-initial required path that no budget was ever
constraining. That is a guidance defect on #4529's surface, not a budget one, and is recorded in
[#4603](https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato/issues/4603) rather than papered over here.

OMH-111 passed before and after the widening (147 s → 132 s), so its fix removes a latent contradiction
rather than an active failure.

OMH-146's file contradiction is resolved — its declared `allowedExtra` path is now reachable. Its live
outcome is mildly unstable for an unrelated reason: across four runs it read
`.ai/guides/modules/ai_assistant.md` and passed three times, and once skipped it and failed on
`required context not observed`. Nothing in that assertion touches a budget; the initial-file count was 4
in every run, under the old ceiling of 4 and the new one of 6 alike.

### 3.2 The six new cases

OMH-196, OMH-197, and OMH-198 passed on their first live run, reaching `.ai/guides/modules/configs.md`,
`perspectives.md`, and `resources.md` respectively with the `architecture` route, `om-help`, and all four
required decisions.

OMH-199, OMH-200, and OMH-201 failed their first run on exactly one assertion — `missing skill om-help` —
while emitting the correct route, observing the installed fact-sheet, and producing every required
decision. The model opened `om-integration-builder` instead, which is the right skill for a spreadsheet
feed, a named payment provider, and a named PIM connector. The assertion was over-specified, so it now
names the skill live routing actually selects; the fact-sheet stays in `context.required`, which is the
part that fails when an agent hand-rolls the capability. All three pass after the retarget.

Final live state for the new cases: **6/6 pass**, each observing its installed module's fact-sheet.

| Case | Fact-sheet reached | Initial files / budget | Initial bytes / budget | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OMH-196 | `configs.md` | 8 / 11 | 47 455 / 57 344 | 231 s |
| OMH-197 | `perspectives.md` | 3 / 11 | 20 759 / 57 344 | 78 s |
| OMH-198 | `resources.md` | 3 / 11 | 20 759 / 57 344 | 113 s |
| OMH-199 | `sync_excel.md` | 4 / 11 | 30 672 / 57 344 | 216 s |
| OMH-200 | `gateway_stripe.md` | 5 / 11 | 32 576 / 57 344 | 107 s |
| OMH-201 | `sync_akeneo.md` | 4 / 11 | 30 672 / 57 344 | 125 s |

Their budgets are inherited from the OMH-194/195 envelope and are, on this evidence, generous rather than
tight — the widest observed use is 8 of 11 files and 83% of the byte budget on OMH-196. They are left as
they are: nothing indicates a false negative, and tightening them from six runs would be its own guess.
OMH-194 and OMH-195 carry their own live evidence in the #4556 execution plan
(`.ai/runs/2026-07-27-standalone-harness-module-facts-cases.md`, steps 3.2 and 4.8); OMH-202 has none, as
§1.2 records.

### 3.3 The thin-budget cohort

Sampled cases with one spare initial file or less all passed with their current budgets: OMH-018
(5 files of 6), OMH-057 (5 of 5 — at the ceiling, one extra read would have failed it), OMH-120 (9 of 10),
OMH-180 (7 of 8). This is why they are reported rather than widened: they are tight, but no observed
correct run is failing on them.

Two cohort failures were unrelated to budgets and are recorded for completeness: OMH-153 missed the `umes`
route, the `om-system-extension` skill, and the extensions guide; OMH-139 exceeded the operator timeout.
