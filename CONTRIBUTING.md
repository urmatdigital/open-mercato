# Contributing to Open Mercato

We’re excited to collaborate with folks building on top of Open Mercato. This guide explains how we organize releases, structure branches, and prepare pull requests so changes land smoothly.

## Branch Model

- `main` – release-ready code. Every commit is tagged and deployable. Keep PRs targeting `main` limited to hotfixes or release prep approved by maintainers.
- `develop` – nightly builds and upcoming release work. Base regular feature work off `develop` so it can soak in automation and shared testing.
- Topic branches – create a dedicated branch per change using the format `feat/<concise-feature-name>` (for example `feat/customer-export`). Use other prefixes when appropriate (`fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`).

## Working on Features

- Branch from `develop`, keeping it up to date via `git pull --rebase origin develop`.
- Keep commits scoped and descriptive. Squash locally if it clarifies the story.
- Follow module conventions from [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and prefer the `packages/` workspace for new code.
- Document user-facing copy in the locale dictionaries and keep translations in sync.

### Spec Driven Development

Before implementing new features or making significant changes, check for an existing spec in `.ai/specs/`:

1. **Check for a spec**: Look for specs named `{YYYY-MM-DD}-{title}.md` related to your feature
2. **Create or update**: If no spec exists, create one following the naming convention `{YYYY-MM-DD}-{title}.md`; if it does, update it with your changes
3. **Maintain the changelog**: Add a dated entry summarizing your changes
4. **Update the directory**: Add new specs to the table in [`.ai/specs/README.md`](.ai/specs/README.md)

This ensures design decisions are documented and the codebase remains well-understood by both humans and AI agents. See [`.ai/specs/README.md`](.ai/specs/README.md) for the full specification directory and [`.ai/specs/AGENTS.md`](.ai/specs/AGENTS.md) for detailed guidelines.

## Pull Requests

- Open PRs against `develop` unless you are coordinating a release hotfix.
- Describe the user impact, architectural notes, and testing performed (lint, unit, integration, CLI).
- Ensure the branch merges cleanly and CI is green before requesting review.
- Reference related issues or discussions; add screenshots or recordings for UI tweaks.
- Tag maintainers early if you need design or architectural guidance.

### Enterprise Module Contributions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **We cannot accept external contributions to the enterprise module.**

The `@open-mercato/enterprise` package (`packages/enterprise/`) is commercial,
proprietary software governed by its own [license](packages/enterprise/LICENSE.md) — not
the open-source terms that cover the rest of this repository. Because of the licensing and
intellectual-property / IP-transfer constraints around that package, **we are unable to
review, accept, or merge pull requests that modify anything under `packages/enterprise/`**,
even when they are otherwise high quality.

What this means in practice:

- Do not open PRs that add to, modify, refactor, or reverse-engineer files under
  `packages/enterprise/`. They will be closed without merge.
- The Contributor License Agreement (see [`apps/docs/cla.md`](apps/docs/cla.md)) governs
  contributions to the open-source projects only; it does not grant rights to the
  commercial enterprise codebase, so it cannot be used to upstream enterprise changes.
- If you have found a bug in an enterprise module, please report it through your
  commercial support channel or open an issue describing the problem (without proposing a
  code change to the package).
- If you want to build or extend enterprise functionality, reach out about the
  [Open Mercato Partnership Program](packages/enterprise/README.md) and commercial
  licensing instead.

Contributions to every other package and app in this repository are welcome — only the
`packages/enterprise/` tree is off-limits.

### Package Previews

PRs do not publish npm canary packages automatically. Maintainers can publish pkg.pr.new package previews for a PR by dispatching the `Package Previews` workflow manually with the PR number — run it from the Actions tab, with `gh workflow run package-previews.yml --ref develop -f pr_number=<PR>`, or via the `om-auto-publish-pr` skill. To publish a fresh preview after more commits, re-run the dispatch with the same PR number.

The legacy npm canary snapshot path is still available for comparison by dispatching the `NPM Snapshot Preview` workflow manually with the PR number on a trusted same-repository PR branch. That workflow publishes real npm canary packages and runs standalone app integration against the exact snapshot, so use it only when pkg.pr.new previews are not enough evidence. Both preview workflows are restricted to same-repository PR branches.

## Developing on Windows

The fastest way to a working dev environment on Windows is the starter: double-click `packages\starter\platform\start.cmd` (no admin needed — it installs a portable, checksum-verified Node 24 and hands off to the cross-platform CLI), or run `npx @open-mercato/starter` if you already have Node. The starter audits the machine, handles corporate proxies and TLS interception (CA capture + provisioning into host tooling, image builds, and the container engine), and starts the stack; WSL2 and Docker Desktop / Rancher Desktop are detected and *proposed* with exact instructions — including a "hand this to IT" sheet from `yarn om doctor` — never installed behind your back. Hardware floor: 16 GB RAM recommended (12 GB minimum), ~20 GB free disk. On machines where host Node workloads are not allowed, use `npx @open-mercato/starter up --mode docker` for the fully containerized stack. Printable EN/PL manuals with troubleshooting live in [`docs/manuals/windows/`](docs/manuals/windows/); the docs site covers the [Windows monorepo path](https://docs.openmercato.com/docs/installation/monorepo) and the [WSL2-native guide](https://docs.openmercato.com/docs/installation/wsl2).

## Releasing

Two channels ship packages to npm:

- **Snapshots** — every push to `develop` runs `Develop Snapshot Release`, publishing under the `develop` dist-tag. Fully automatic; nothing to do.
- **Stable releases** — a maintainer-driven two-stage flow off `main`, described below.

Stable releases are split across two workflows on purpose. `main` is protected, so a workflow cannot push a version bump to it directly; the bump lands through a normal PR, and the publishing workflow only ever pushes a tag.

### Stage 0 — land the changelog

Add the `# <version> (YYYY-MM-DD)` section to [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) and merge it to `main`. The release workflow reads its GitHub Release notes from this section and **fails without it**, so this comes first. The `om-auto-update-changelog` skill drafts the entry.

### Stage 1 — `Release Prepare`

Dispatch **Release Prepare** from the Actions tab with a `patch`, `minor` or `major` bump:

```bash
gh workflow run release-prepare.yml --ref main -f bump=patch
```

It bumps every public package, the app workspaces (`apps/*`) and the root manifest, pushes `release/v<version>`, and opens a PR against `main`. It publishes nothing. The PR body confirms whether the changelog entry exists. Review and merge it as usual.

> Opening the PR automatically requires _Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"_. Without it the branch is still pushed and the job summary links straight to the compare page — one click instead of zero.

### Stage 2 — `Release`

With the bump on `main`, dispatch **Release**:

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml --ref main
```

The job requires approval from the `production` environment, then runs in a deliberate order — every reversible step before the irreversible one:

1. **Preflight** — version alignment across packages and app workspaces, the version is not already on npm, and the changelog section exists. Nothing has happened yet if any of these fail.
2. **Build** — `build:packages`, `generate`, `build:packages`.
3. **Tag** — pushes `v<version>`. A tag is cheap to delete; an npm version is not.
4. **Publish** — `publish-packages.sh` with npm provenance, skipping anything already published.
5. **GitHub Release** — notes built from the changelog section plus the published-package table.

### Resuming a failed release

If publishing fails partway, packages are already on npm and cannot be republished — npm is ahead of git, and the repository has to catch up. Both stages take the same `resume` flag for this, which relaxes the guards that would otherwise refuse an already-published version.

If the version bump never landed on `main`, run the whole flow again with `resume: true`:

```bash
gh workflow run release-prepare.yml --ref main -f bump=patch -f resume=true
# merge the recovery PR, then
gh workflow run release.yml --ref main -f resume=true
```

If the bump is already on `main` and only publishing failed, just the second command is needed.

In resume mode, `Release Prepare` skips the "not on npm yet" and "tag does not exist" checks and marks the PR as a recovery; `Release` skips the same npm preflight, skips packages that already published, reuses the existing tag, and refreshes the release notes instead of failing.

> `resume` disables the guard that prevents double-publishing. Use it only when a run died *after* npm publish — on a normal release it removes a check you want.

### Local equivalents

`yarn release:{patch,minor,major}` bump, build and publish from a working copy; `yarn release:existing` publishes the version already in the root `package.json`. None of them tag or push — prefer the workflows. Useful for inspection:

```bash
yarn release:bump patch                 # bump manifests only, no build or publish
yarn release:check-unpublished 0.6.8    # is this version already on npm?
./scripts/changelog-section.sh 0.6.8    # preview the release notes body
```
