/**
 * Shared StrykerJS configuration factory — one source of truth for every package.
 *
 * Per-package configuration is forced, not chosen: every package carries its own
 * `jest.config.cjs` with its own `rootDir`, `moduleNameMapper`, and a transformer
 * referenced as `<rootDir>/../../scripts/jest-mikroorm-transformer.cjs`. A single
 * root Stryker config cannot drive them. This factory keeps the shared settings in
 * one file while each package's `stryker.conf.mjs` supplies only its own name.
 *
 * Three settings below are load-bearing workarounds measured in the Phase 0 pilot
 * (`.ai/analysis/2026-07-31-stryker-mutation-testing-pilot.md`) — changing them
 * breaks the run outright rather than degrading it:
 *
 *   inPlace: true          Stryker's default sandbox copies the package one directory
 *                          deeper, so every relative path in the per-package jest
 *                          config resolves outside the sandbox and the run dies with
 *                          `Cannot find module '../../jest.config.base.cjs'`.
 *                          `inPlace` also short-circuits Stryker's tsconfig
 *                          preprocessor, which calls `ts.parseConfigFileTextToJson` —
 *                          absent from this repo's typescript@7.0.2 (the Go compiler;
 *                          the JS API lives behind the `typescript-js` alias, see
 *                          scripts/jest-typescript-resolver.cjs).
 *
 *   coverageAnalysis: off  `@jest-environment` docblocks in existing suites block
 *                          `perTest` and `all`. Fixing that means editing dozens of
 *                          unrelated test files, which the spec rules out.
 *
 *   excludedMutations      `StringLiteral` and `Regex` mutants are the cheapest way to
 *                          game a mutation score — killing them rewards asserting exact
 *                          log strings and error copy instead of behaviour.
 *
 * @see .ai/specs/2026-07-31-stryker-mutation-testing-ci-gate.md

 * `testTimeout: 30000` in its jest config and needs the larger budget; every other
