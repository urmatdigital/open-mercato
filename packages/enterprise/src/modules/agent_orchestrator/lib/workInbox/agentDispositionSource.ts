/**
 * Work Inbox — the `agent_disposition` source.
 *
 * ## Why this source exists
 *
 * `dispositionService` raises a proposal for a human when the auto-approve rule
 * declines to act. That work belongs to nobody in particular: the module cannot
 * pick a tenant user without inventing routing policy that belongs in the
 * workflow definition, and it cannot name a role because `assignedToRoles` holds
 * tenant role NAMES that a rename would orphan silently. Under §6.4 —
 * "you see a task iff it is yours" — an item with no owner is an item nobody
 * sees, so without a visibility class of its own the whole queue would go dark.
 *
 * The class is `administrativeQueueFeature`: an ACL feature that admits a
 * principal to a source's unassigned rows, declaring "this kind is an
 * administrative queue, not personal work". Here it is
 * `agent_orchestrator.proposals.view`, which the seeded `admin`, `employee`,
 * `operator` and `engineer` roles already hold — so the population that can see
 * disposition work is exactly the population that could act on it before, while
 * a workflows-only user with no orchestrator grant stops seeing it. That is the
 * intended narrowing.
 *
 * ## What it lists, and why not the `UserTask` rows
 *
 * The `AgentProposal` rows awaiting human disposition — NOT the shadow
 * `UserTask` rows `dispositionService` also writes. Three reasons:
 *
 * 1. **Disposing the proposal is what unblocks the run.** A parked
 *    `INVOKE_AGENT` resumes from the dispose path, never from the task row, so
 *    the proposal is the work item and the task row is a pointer at it.
 * 2. **Listing the task rows here would double-list them.** They are ordinary
 *    `user_tasks`, already served by core's `user_task` source, and core cannot
 *    exclude them without learning an enterprise-owned discriminator — exactly
 *    the coupling the provider contract exists to avoid. A tenant `admin` holds
 *    both grants and would see every disposition item twice.
 * 3. **`dispositionService.ts` stays untouched.** The auto-approve boundary it
 *    guards is not moved, so its Ask-First gate does not fire.
 *
 * The shadow `UserTask` rows therefore remain visible to `workflows.tasks.view_all`
 * holders through core's source, which is the correct reading of what they are:
 * administrative residue. Nothing closes them today — that is defect A7, filed
 * separately and deliberately not fixed here.
