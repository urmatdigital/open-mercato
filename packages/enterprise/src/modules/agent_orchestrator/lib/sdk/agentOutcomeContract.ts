/**
 * Agent OUTCOME contract resolution.
 *
 * Every registered agent's result schema is the SAME envelope regardless of how
 * it was authored: `defineAgent` declares `z.object({ kind, proposal | data })`
 * and `compileOutcome` builds exactly that shape from a file agent's OUTCOME.md.
 * The OUTCOME itself — what an author actually wants to map into a workflow
 * context or read in the Playground — is therefore the inner `data` (researcher)
 * or `proposal` (proposal) property of that envelope.
 *
 * Two projections of the same thing:
 * - `resolveAgentOutcomeZod` returns the inner Zod schema (consumed in-process,
 *   e.g. by the workflows INVOKE_AGENT output-contract bridge).
 * - `resolveAgentOutcomeJsonSchema` returns the inner JSON-Schema for the wire.
 *   File agents carry the authored JSON-Schema verbatim (`entry.outcomeSchema`);
 *   in-process agents have no such artifact, so their Zod is converted with the
 *   platform's OpenAPI converter.
 *
 * Both degrade to `undefined` rather than guessing: an agent whose result schema
 * is not the declared envelope simply exposes no outcome contract.
