// `deals.health_check` is the demo agent for the MVP end-to-end flow (area 05).
// Authoring is code (here), not a DB seed: the ai_assistant generator discovers
// `ai-agents.ts` and `defineAgent` emits a standard AiAgentDefinition (object
// mode) while registering { id, resultKind, schema } in the area-01 registry.
// The id is the STABLE contract id referenced by the demo workflow definition's
// INVOKE_AGENT step (`examples/deals-health-check-workflow.json`) and the
// runbook in mvp/05-seed-and-demo.md.
//
// Result: an `proposal` proposal carrying a single `set_stage` action plus a
// confidence score. The disposition gate (area 03) auto-approves when
// `confidence >= autoApproveThreshold` (0.8 on the demo node) and otherwise
// raises a USER_TASK / proposal for an operator. The effector step applies the
// approved `set_stage` payload to the deal via the audited customers command.
