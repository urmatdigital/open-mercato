/**
 * Every `/backend/...` the module navigates to must be a page that exists.
 *
 * Both P0s in the 2026-08-11 evals audit were the same bug: the agent-centric
 * consolidation (#4489) deleted the eval-cases LIST page, and two references
 * outlived it — the trace inspector's "View eval set" button and an integration
 * test asserting that page lists drafts. The button was a dead end for months
 * and the test had been failing in CI the whole time.
 *
 * Nothing type-checks a route string, so nothing caught either. This does.
 *
 * The check is deliberately narrow: literal `/backend/...` paths with a static
 * first segment, resolved against the page files this module actually declares
 * plus a small allowlist of routes owned by other modules. A template literal
 * whose interpolation lands mid-segment is skipped rather than guessed at —
 * the goal is zero false positives, because a guard people learn to skip is
 * worse than no guard.
