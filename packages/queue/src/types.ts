  /**
   * Called when the queue permanently gives up on a job WITHOUT its handler having run.
   *
   * Why this cannot be left to the handler: a queue may destroy a job before ever calling the
   * processor — the usual cause is a job redelivered once too often, past `maxStalledCount`. The
   * handler then never runs, never throws and never learns, and any state it created on enqueue (a
   * run row, a progress record) is orphaned in whatever "in progress" state it was left in, with
   * nothing to correct it.
   *
   * Contract:
   * - Fires **only** for a job the queue abandoned before its handler ran. It is deliberately not a
   *   general "job failed" hook: a handler that ran and threw owns its own outcome and has already
   *   had the chance to record it. Reporting both would double-report and would hide the difference
   *   between "the work failed" and "the work never started".
   * - **At-least-once, where the backend allows it.** The strategy reports as soon as it observes
   *   the abandonment, and also sweeps the backend's dead-job records — on worker start, then
   *   periodically — for reports that were never acknowledged. A report is acknowledged only after
   *   this callback returns, so a callback that threw or a process that died mid-report is retried
   *   by a later sweep. The callback MUST therefore be idempotent, and MUST tolerate a payload it
   *   does not recognise. Residual loss is still possible when the backend evicts its dead-job
   *   records before any sweep sees them; state that absolutely must never be stranded should also
   *   have a staleness check of its own at the domain level.
   * - Not every strategy can implement it — the local strategy runs handlers in-process, so no queue
   *   outlives a handler to abandon its job.
   *
   * Backend specifics (which failures count as abandonment, and how they are detected) belong to the
   * strategy; see `strategies/async.ts`.
