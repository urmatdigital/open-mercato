/**
 * TC-CUSTOMERS-SEED-001: `mercato customers seed-examples` stays idempotent when tenant
 * data encryption is active.
 *
 * Reproduces the defect fixed in `modules/customers/cli.ts`: the idempotency guard filtered
 * `customer_deal.title` with a plaintext `$in`, but that column is encryption-mapped
 * (`modules/customers/encryption.ts`). Decryption happens on load, not on filter, so the
 * predicate reached Postgres as written, compared against ciphertext, matched nothing, and
 * raised nothing — the guard fell through and every re-run duplicated the whole example batch.
 *
 * Why this needs an integration test rather than a unit test: the bug *is* the encryption
 * boundary. A unit test has to mock the decryption helper, which is precisely the component
 * that was broken, so it can only prove the guard calls a helper — never that the guard works
 * against a real encrypted column. This exercises the real CLI, a real database, and a real
 * derived-key KMS.
 *
 * Verified-against-source contract (`modules/customers/cli.ts`, `seed-examples` command):
 * - seeding an untouched organization logs `Customer example data seeded for organization <id>`
 * - a re-run whose guard fires logs `Customer example data already present; skipping`
 * so the second run's stdout is a direct oracle for the guard, with no row counting needed.
 *
 * Two preconditions have to hold or this test passes vacuously, so both are asserted rather than
 * assumed:
 *
 * 1. **A real KMS.** Without one the runtime falls back to a noop provider that stores plaintext.
 *    `TENANT_DATA_ENCRYPTION_FALLBACK_KEY` selects the derived-key KMS
 *    (`shared/lib/encryption/kms.ts`, `createKmsService`) so mapped columns are genuinely encrypted.
 * 2. **An active encryption map row.** `TenantDataEncryptionService` resolves which fields to
 *    encrypt from the `encryption_maps` table, scoped by `(entity_id, tenant_id, organization_id)`
 *    (`shared/lib/encryption/tenantDataEncryptionService.ts:223`). A freshly created organization has
 *    no such row, so `mercato entities seed-encryption` must run first — an earlier draft of this
 *    test omitted it and passed even against the unfixed guard, proving nothing.
 *
 * Both runs share one environment, keeping the test independent of the surrounding harness config.
