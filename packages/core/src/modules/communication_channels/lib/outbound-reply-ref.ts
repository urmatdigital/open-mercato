 * always produced. Chat providers had no equivalent: `capabilities.threading`
 * described a reply-attachment the hub could never ask for, because nothing on
 * the outbound path wrote the parent's external id into channel metadata
 * (#5541 — the flag had to be declared `false` to stay honest). This is that
 * missing producer.
 *
 * The hub stores everything needed already: the parent hub message owns a
 * `MessageChannelLink` (unique per `message_id`) whose `external_message_id`
 * points at the `ExternalMessage` row carrying the provider's own id — written
 * by both the inbound ingest and outbound delivery paths, so a reply can answer
 * an inbound message or one of our own sends.
 *
 * Returns `null` — never throws a routing decision at the caller — when the
 * provider does not thread, the message is not a reply, the parent never
 * reached this channel, or the parent belongs to a different conversation.
 * Threading is an enhancement to a delivery, never a precondition for one.
