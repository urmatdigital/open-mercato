# Progress Module — Agent Guidelines

Use the progress module for every user-visible bulk operation and every long-running operation. Keep `ProgressTopBar` the single shared progress surface.

## Always

1. **MUST create `ProgressJob` for durable work** — imports, exports, bulk mutations, reindexing, external sync, and queued work must persist progress server-side.
2. **MUST return `progressJobId` to the UI** — DataTable bulk actions and start-operation APIs must expose the job id so the top bar can track it.
3. **MUST update terminal status** — every job must reach `completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`; never leave running jobs without heartbeat/progress updates.
4. **MUST scope by tenant and organization** — create, read, update, cancel, and worker payloads must carry `tenantId` and `organizationId`.
5. **MUST use queue workers for durable work** — use `@open-mercato/queue`; do not implement custom queues, timers, or page polling loops.
6. **MUST run mutations through commands** — workers must use `commandBus.execute(...)` for domain writes so audit, undo, cache, events, and index invalidation stay intact.
7. **MUST use client-local progress only for browser-bound loops** — local `client:*` progress events are best-effort and must not represent work that should survive navigation.

## Ask First

- Ask before adding a new progress mode, changing job terminal states, or changing cancellation semantics.
- Ask before creating a module-specific progress UI for work that could use the shared top bar.

## Never

- Never leave running jobs without heartbeat/progress updates.
- Never implement custom queues, timers, or page polling loops for durable work.
- Never represent durable server work with client-local `client:*` progress events.
- Never build per-module progress bars for global operations — use `ProgressTopBar` and shared progress hooks.

## Validation Commands

```bash
yarn generate
yarn workspace @open-mercato/core build
```

## Choosing Progress Mode

| When to use | Progress mode |
|-------------|---------------|
| Bulk delete/update/create, import/export, reindexing, external sync, report generation, long AI/tool execution | Server `ProgressJob` + queue worker |
| DataTable selected-row loop that must keep response-side metadata in the browser and completes in-page | Shared client-local progress events |
| Single-row CRUD action that normally completes quickly | Button/loading state + audit `LastOperationBanner`; no `ProgressJob` by default |
| Cancellable background operation | Server `ProgressJob` with `cancellable: true` and worker checks via `isCancellationRequested()` |

## Adding a Server-Side Bulk Operation

1. Create an API route that validates input with Zod and requires the module manage feature.
2. Resolve `progressService` from DI and call `createJob({ jobType, name, description, totalCount, cancellable, meta }, scope)`.
3. Enqueue a worker payload containing `progressJobId`, ids/filter criteria, and trusted `{ tenantId, organizationId, userId }` scope.
4. Return `202` with `{ ok: true, progressJobId, message }`.
5. In the worker, call `startJob`, process records through `commandBus.execute(...)`, update progress after each item or batch, and call `completeJob`.
6. Catch failures, call `failJob`, then rethrow so queue retry/error handling remains truthful.
7. Run `yarn generate` after adding worker files and test with the queue strategy used by the target environment.

## Adding a DataTable Bulk Action

1. Prefer an injected `:bulk-actions` widget for cross-module bulk actions; use the `bulkActions` prop only for host-owned actions.
2. For server-side work, call the start API and return `{ ok: true, progressJobId }` from `onExecute`.
3. For browser-bound loops, call shared UI bulk helpers with progress metadata; never maintain custom page-local progress state.
4. Keep destructive confirmation in the action before starting work.
5. Clear selection only after work starts or finishes through the DataTable bulk action contract.
6. Add unit coverage for progress emission or `progressJobId` handling.

## Job Type Naming

Use stable, grep-friendly ids:

| Operation | Job type |
|-----------|----------|
| Catalog product bulk delete | `catalog.products.bulk_delete` |
| Customer people bulk delete | `customers.people.bulk_delete` |
| Customer companies bulk delete | `customers.companies.bulk_delete` |
| Customer deals bulk delete | `customers.deals.bulk_delete` |
| Future operations | `<module>.<surface_or_resource>.<operation>` |

## Environment

| Variable | Effect | Default |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `OM_PROGRESS_BROADCAST_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` | Coalesces intermediate `progress.job.updated` broadcasts per job: the service emits only when this many ms elapsed since the last broadcast **or** `progressPercent` advanced by ≥1; sub-threshold updates buffer in memory. Keeps bulk workers from firing one serialized `pg_notify` roundtrip + tenant-wide SSE fan-out per record. Persistence is throttled independently: heartbeats reach the database at least every `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_MS` (5s) regardless of this knob, so no value can starve the 60s `STALE_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` sweep. Terminal events (`created`/`started`/`completed`/`failed`/`cancelled`) are never throttled. Set to `0` to restore per-record emission (tests/debugging). | `250` |

## Concurrency Semantics (multi-instance safe)

`progressService` is safe to run across many app/worker instances. Do not reintroduce read-modify-write transitions:

- **Every status transition is a status-guarded `nativeUpdate` (CAS).** An update that matches zero rows lost the race — it MUST NOT emit events or overwrite the row. Allowed transitions: start from `pending|failed` (an already-running start is an idempotent no-op; `failed` allows queue retries and recovery from a wrong stale sweep), complete from `pending|running|failed`, fail from `pending|running`, cancel from `pending|running|failed`.
- **Progress writes are guarded on `status IN ('pending','running')`** — once another process finishes/cancels a job, buffered updaters stop writing to it. Exception: when a write path finds the job `failed`, it attempts exactly one revival through the start CAS (a live producer writing progress proves a stale sweep false-positived) before giving up. That revive CAS is narrowed to rows whose `errorMessage` starts with `STALE_SWEEP_ERROR_PREFIX`, so a job that failed for a real reason keeps its message and stack instead of being resurrected by a racing buffered writer; `completed`/`cancelled` are never revived, and genuinely dead producers never write again, so real sweeps stick. Only `startJob` uses the unrestricted CAS, because a queue retry restarts the whole unit of work. A revive never resets `startedAt` — progress counts are absolute across deliveries, so the elapsed window `calculateEta` divides them by must be too.
- **Long single units of work MUST call `touchJobHeartbeat`** — when one batch/step can outlast `STALE_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (60s), run a keepalive that calls the optional `touchJobHeartbeat(jobId, ctx)` while awaiting it (see `withHeartbeat` in `data_sync/lib/sync-engine.ts`). It writes only `heartbeat_at`/`updated_at` on a **forked** EntityManager, so it is safe while the producer's own EM is mid-transaction, and it self-heals a falsely-swept job via the start CAS. Always optional-chain it (`progressService.touchJobHeartbeat?.(...)`) — third-party implementations may not provide it. The "no timers for durable work" rule below bans replacing queue delivery with timers, not an in-process keepalive around a pending await.
- **`incrementProgress` deltas persist as atomic SQL increments** (`processed_count + n`), and the service reloads the database winner before returning or emitting, so concurrent writers never lose or report stale counts.
- **Update-path reads use `disableIdentityMap: true`** — `isCancellationRequested` and lifecycle reads must always see fresh cross-process state, never a stale managed entity.
- **The stale sweep (`markStaleJobsFailed`) re-checks staleness per row inside the CAS**, so concurrent sweepers emit exactly one `JOB_FAILED` per job, and it also fails `pending` jobs that never started within `STALE_PENDING_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (a late queue delivery recovers them via `startJob`'s `failed → running` transition).
