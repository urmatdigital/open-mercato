/**
 * Cache tags shared by the WMS inventory enrichers and the write surfaces that
 * invalidate them. Read side and write side MUST use these constants so the two
 * cannot drift — a tag typo on either side is silent, and the only symptom is
 * inventory that stays stale until the TTL expires.
 *
 * The enricher runner adds `tenant:`, `organization:` and `enricher:` tags of
 * its own, and the cache service prefixes every tag with the current cache
 * tenant, so these are deliberately coarse collection tags rather than
 * per-warehouse ones: `ResponseEnricher.cache.tags` is a static array read from
 * the enricher definition and cannot vary per call. Collection tags
 * over-invalidate slightly; a per-warehouse scheme that the write side could
 * miss would under-invalidate, which is the failure that actually shows wrong
 * stock to a user.
