 * TC-PUSH-005 — a retryable provider error is retried to `MAX_ATTEMPTS` and then expires.
 *
 * `expired` (retries exhausted) is a distinct terminal state from `failed` (permanent error), and the
 * device must survive: a transient provider outage must never soft-delete a user's device.
 *
 * Each attempt re-enqueues with exponential backoff + jitter (~1-2s, then ~2-3s), so a single drain can
 * only ever advance one attempt — the terminal state is unreachable without draining across the delays.
