# Data Sync Module — Agent Guide

The `data_sync` module provides a streaming data synchronization hub for import/export operations with external systems. It uses an adapter pattern where provider modules register `DataSyncAdapter` implementations.

**Spec**: `.ai/specs/implemented/SPEC-045b-data-sync-hub.md`

---

## Always

- **Always scope by organizationId + tenantId** — every entity query
- **Resolve the organization in API routes with `resolveActiveOrganizationId(auth)`** from `@open-mercato/shared/lib/auth/organizationScope`, never with raw `auth.orgId` — a super-admin viewing "all organizations" has `auth.orgId === null`. The fallback is tenant-aware: it never pairs the actor organization with a foreign selected tenant. When it returns `null` for an authenticated caller, answer with `organizationScopeRequiredResponse()` (400) — never 401, which sends `apiFetch` into a session-refresh loop
- **Use the queue system** — never run syncs inline in API handlers
- **New sync providers MUST support provider-owned env preconfiguration** when fresh installs need credentials or default mappings/locales/channels from deployment env
- **Persist cursor after each batch** — enables resume on failure
- **Log item-level errors** — don't stop the sync for individual item failures
- **Check for overlap** before starting a new run (same integration + entityType + direction)
- **API routes must export `openApi`** for documentation generation

## Ask First

- Ask before changing adapter contracts, run lifecycle states, cursor semantics, queue names, or overlap detection.
- Ask before adding provider-specific logic to this generic module.
- Ask before changing progress delivery or cancellation behavior.

## Never

- Never import from provider adapter modules — `data_sync` is generic.
- Never run syncs inline in API handlers.
- Never add frontend polling loops for sync progress beyond initial hydration or reconnect recovery.
- Never special-case provider credentials, mappings, or state in `data_sync`.

## Validation Commands

## Key Services (DI)

| Service Name | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `dataSyncRunService` | CRUD for SyncRun, cursor management, overlap detection |
| `dataSyncEngine` | Orchestrates streaming import/export with batch processing, progress, error logging |
| `externalIdMappingService` | Maps local entity IDs ↔ external system IDs |

## Adapter Contract

Provider modules implement `DataSyncAdapter`:

```typescript
interface DataSyncAdapter {
  readonly providerKey: string
  readonly direction: 'import' | 'export' | 'bidirectional'
  readonly supportedEntities: string[]
  readonly runMode?: 'generic' | 'provider'
  readonly operationalTelemetry?: boolean
  readonly runParameters?: RunParameter[]

  streamImport?(input: StreamImportInput): AsyncIterable<ImportBatch>
  streamExport?(input: StreamExportInput): AsyncIterable<ExportBatch>
  getInitialCursor?(input: { entityType: string; scope: TenantScope }): Promise<string | null>
  getMapping(input: { entityType: string; scope: TenantScope }): Promise<DataMapping>
  persistsSharedCursor?(entityType: string): boolean
  validateConnection?(input: {
    entityType: string
    credentials: Record<string, unknown>
    mapping: DataMapping
    scope: TenantScope
  }): Promise<ValidationResult>
}
```

All hooks take a single input object — see `lib/adapter.ts` for the authoritative
shapes.

Register adapters in your provider module's `di.ts`:
```typescript
registerDataSyncAdapter(myAdapter)
```

### Run parameters

Adapters may declare optional, operator-facing `runParameters`. The dashboard
renders a generic input per declared parameter, the run API validates and
coerces the submitted values against the declaration (`lib/run-parameters.ts`),
and the normalized values are persisted on the run and passed back on
`StreamImportInput.parameters` / `StreamExportInput.parameters`. Keep
declarations provider-agnostic — never special-case a provider in `data_sync`.

```typescript
runParameters: [
  { key: 'dryRun', label: 'Dry run', type: 'boolean', defaultValue: false,
    description: 'Report what would change without writing.' },
  { key: 'startId', label: 'Start id', type: 'number', min: 0 },
  { key: 'mode', label: 'Mode', type: 'select',
    options: [{ value: 'fast' }, { value: 'thorough' }] },
  // Only offered when the orders entity is selected:
  { key: 'bulk', label: 'Bulk reindex', type: 'boolean', entityType: 'sales_orders' },
]
```

Supported types: `boolean`, `string`, `number`, `select`. A parameter may set
`direction` to apply to only `import` or `export` runs, and `entityType`
(a `supportedEntities` value or an array of them) to apply only when that
entity is selected — use it when a knob only makes sense for one entity's run.
Params without `direction` / `entityType` apply to every run. Blank values fall
back to `defaultValue`; values are retained across retries.

Run parameters are **operator-visible and stored in clear text** on
`sync_runs.parameters`, and rendered read-only on the run detail page. Never
declare a parameter that carries a secret — credentials belong in
`integrationCredentialsService`.

**Translation.** `label`, `description` and `placeholder` are literals, so an
adapter shipping to more than one locale MUST also set `labelKey` /
`descriptionKey` / `placeholderKey`; the dashboard prefers the key and falls
back to the literal. Validation failures come back from the API as
`{ key, code, params, message }` — the UI renders `code` through
`data_sync.runParameters.errors.<code>` and only uses the English `message` as
a fallback, so never rely on the sentence text.

**Retry re-validates.** `POST /api/data_sync/runs/[id]/retry` re-runs the stored
values through `normalizeRunParameters` against the *current* declaration:
parameters you have since removed or re-scoped fall away, and a value that no
longer satisfies its declaration fails the retry with a 422 instead of reaching
the adapter. An adapter therefore never receives a set the run API would reject
today — tighten a bound freely.

The integration detail page's schedule table also starts runs, but has no room
for a parameter form: it submits the declared defaults and refuses the run when
an applicable parameter is `required` with no `defaultValue`, pointing the
operator at the Data Sync dashboard. Declare a `defaultValue` for anything that
should stay launchable from that table.

**Recurring runs get your defaults, not operator values.** A `SyncSchedule`
cannot yet pin a chosen value, but the scheduled worker normalizes an empty
input against your declaration, so a scheduled run hands you the same set an
untouched dashboard form would — never an empty object. Write your adapter
against the defaults, not against `undefined`. A default that violates its own
declaration skips the scheduled run with a logged error instead of starting it
with a half-applied set.

If the sync provider needs bootstrap credentials, mappings, locales, channels, or other default sync settings after a fresh install, implement a provider-owned env preset flow:

- read env vars in the provider package
- apply them from the provider module's `setup.ts`
- expose a provider CLI command to rerun the preset outside tenant creation
- persist through normal credentials/mapping/state services instead of special-casing the provider in `data_sync`

## Run Lifecycle

`pending` → `running` → `completed` | `failed` | `cancelled`

- **Cursor persistence**: After each batch, the cursor is saved on the run row and mirrored into the shared `SyncCursor` row
- **Shared cursor opt-out**: An adapter returning `persistsSharedCursor(entityType) === false` keeps that entity type's cursor on the run row only — use it for whole-table backfills whose cursor is one run's scan state, not a durable log position. Those entity types resolve an incremental start position from the most recent run (`resolveResumeCursor`) instead of the shared row, and from `null` when that run completed
- **Resetting an opt-out**: A reset flow that deletes the shared `SyncCursor` row MUST also call `syncRunService.resetResumePosition(integrationId, entityType, direction, scope)`. An opted-out entity type has no shared row to delete, so deleting only that leaves the resume position on the last interrupted run and the next incremental run re-imports just the tail of the walk it was reset against. The call is a no-op when nothing is interrupted, so make it unconditionally
- **Resume**: Retry reads the last successful cursor, resumes from there
- **Progress**: Linked to `ProgressJob` via `progressJobId` for `ProgressTopBar` display
- **Cancellation**: Via `progressService.isCancellationRequested()`
- **Tracing**: The engine emits one **root** span per batch (`data_sync.import.batch` / `data_sync.export.batch`) linked back to the run, covering the adapter's read *and* the engine's bookkeeping. Adapters MUST NOT hand-roll their own batch span — they cannot root it, so a multi-day run would ride on the single sampling decision taken for the request that triggered it. Inner spans an adapter creates nest under the batch span normally. The final read — the one that finds the stream drained — is traced as `data_sync.import.drain` / `data_sync.export.drain`, so N batches emit exactly N `*.batch` spans plus one `*.drain`.
- **Stream shape**: The engine drives the adapter's async iterator explicitly (`batch-stream.ts`) so the span wraps `next()`, where a generator does its real work before yielding. Closing follows the language's own `IteratorClose` rules, so `finally` blocks in an adapter generator behave exactly as under `for await`: no `return()` when the stream exhausts or `next()` throws (already closed), `return()` with its failure surfaced on an early stop, and `return()` with its failure swallowed when the engine's own handler threw (that error wins). Keep cleanup in `finally`.

## Queue Names

- `data_sync.configure` — manage field mappings and schedules

## UMES Extensibility

Data sync providers can leverage the **Unified Module Extension System (UMES)** to extend platform UI and behavior.

### Available Extension Points for Sync Providers

| Extension Mechanism | Use Case | Files |
|---|---|---|
| **Widget Injection** | Inject sync status badges, mapping previews, or progress indicators into entity pages | `widgets/injection/`, `widgets/injection-table.ts` |
| **Event Subscribers** | React to sync lifecycle events (`data_sync.run.completed`, etc.) for side-effects | `subscribers/*.ts` |
| **Entity Extensions** | Link sync metadata to core entities | `data/extensions.ts` |
| **Response Enrichers** | Attach sync status or external ID data to other modules' API responses | `data/enrichers.ts` |
| **Notifications** | Emit in-app notifications on sync completion/failure | `notifications.ts`, `subscribers/` |
| **DOM Event Bridge** | Push real-time sync progress to browser (SSE) | Set `clientBroadcast: true` in event definitions |
| **Menu Injection** | Add sidebar items for provider-specific sync dashboards | via `useInjectedMenuItems` |

### Progress Delivery Contract

- `ProgressTopBar` and sync-run detail pages use `progress.job.*` SSE updates for live progress.
- Create `ProgressJob` in `run`/`retry` endpoints; start/update/complete/fail in `sync-engine`.
- The engine heartbeats (`touchJobHeartbeat`, forked-EM) on a timer while an adapter batch is being produced, because batches can outlast the 60s stale-job sweep — keep the `withHeartbeat` wrapper around `streamImport`/`streamExport` when touching the batch loops.
- On redelivery the progress counter is seeded from the progress job's own `processedCount` (`progressService.getJob`), mirroring how `committedBatches` resumes — never reset it to zero (`updateProgress` writes absolute counts) and never seed it from the run's `created/updated/skipped/failed` columns: those count emitted items, while progress counts source records (`batch.processedCount`), and adapters may emit several items per source record.
- Include `progressJob` details in run detail response.
- SSE DOM bridge forwards only events with `clientBroadcast: true`.
- `progress.job.*` events are marked `clientBroadcast: true` and must reach the browser from both web and worker processes.
- Do not add new frontend polling loops for sync progress; use one-shot fetches only for initial hydration or reconnect recovery.

### Integration Test Expectations

- Module-local integration tests go under `__integration__/`
- Use helpers from `@open-mercato/core/modules/core/__integration__/helpers/*`
- Tests must create prerequisites via API and clean up in `finally`
- Avoid hard dependency on late-phase modules; keep tests scoped to implemented contracts
