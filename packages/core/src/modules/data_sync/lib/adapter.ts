   * `fullSync` to the same run API. An adapter that declares `fullSync`

   * place a run can be started.
   *
   * This governs what the dashboard OFFERS, not what the API accepts:
   * `POST /api/data_sync/run` keeps honouring both fields, so a client that
   * posts `fullSync: true` still gets a `null` cursor whatever this returns.
   *
   * The predicate is per entity type for the same reason
   * {@link DataSyncAdapter.persistsSharedCursor} is — one adapter commonly
   * serves both an incremental feed and a whole-table backfill, and only one of
