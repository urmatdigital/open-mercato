/**
 * Fail the run behind a job the queue gave up on.
 *
 * A resumable data_sync job is ONE long-lived job for a whole run — `runImport` is entered once and
 * stays there for the duration, which for a full backfill is days. Every worker death (a deploy, an
 * OOM) therefore stalls that job, and BullMQ's stalled counter is cumulative for the job's life:
 * past `DATA_SYNC_MAX_STALLED_COUNT` it writes a deferred failure and the next worker fails the job
 * BEFORE calling the processor.
 *
 * So `runImport` never runs, never throws, and never finalizes — and `sync_runs` is left saying
 * `running` for a run nothing is running, forever. That is the residual state `queue-policy.ts`
 * describes as what remains after a job exhausts its stall budget; this repairs it.
 *
 * It only ever moves a non-terminal run: `markStatus` refuses to overwrite `completed` / `failed` /
 * `cancelled`, so a job abandoned after its run has ended is a no-op. `onJobAbandoned` may deliver
 * the same job more than once, which for the same reason is also a no-op.
 *
 * The run's progress job is failed alongside it, the way the worker's own catch path does in
 * `workers/sync-import.ts`. Without that the two halves disagree — the run reads `failed` while the
 * operation still shows as in flight in the top bar — until the progress staleness sweep eventually
 * fails it with a generic no-heartbeat message instead of the reason the queue recorded.
