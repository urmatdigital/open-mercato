/**
 * TC-WF-061 [P0]: failure-queue triage, and a bulk replay that actually replays.
 *
 * Spec `.ai/specs/2026-07-26-workflows-ux-redesign.md` §8.4: *"**Failure queue +
 * bulk replay:** `Send to failure queue` directive parks instances as ATTENTION;
 * with FAILED instances they form a triage list with error grouping; bulk
 * retry/cancel runs through the progress module."*
 *
 * Three claims, asserted as three things rather than as one 200:
 * 1. the list is a UNION — an attention-parked instance and a FAILED one appear
 *    side by side, which the instance list route cannot express because it ANDs
 *    its `attention` and `status` filters;
 * 2. the grouping NORMALIZES — the group key replaces ids/numbers/quoted values
 *    with placeholders while the label keeps one raw message, and asking for that
 *    key narrows the list;
 * 3. the bulk replay REPLAYS — the queued progress job completes, the parked
 *    instances gain an attempt, their attention marker is cleared and they leave
 *    the queue. A 202 on its own proves only that a job was enqueued.
 *
 * Every assertion is scoped to this spec's own instance ids: the failure queue is
 * a shared, accumulating surface, so a total or a group count would be a
 * different test's data.
 *
 * Surfaces under test:
 * - GET  /api/workflows/instances/failure-queue (+ `?errorGroup=`)
 * - POST /api/workflows/instances/bulk-replay
 * - GET  /api/progress/jobs/[id]
 * - /backend/instances/failure-queue (the triage page)
