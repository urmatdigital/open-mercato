/**
 * Per-definition operational KPIs (spec §8.5) — the PURE arithmetic half.
 *
 * This module contains no ORM, DI, React or registry import, so every rule it
 * encodes is unit-testable without a database. `lib/metrics/rollup-service.ts`
 * owns the queries and the upsert; this file owns what the numbers MEAN.
 *
 * Three honesty rules govern what may appear here:
 *
 * 1. **A metric is computed only from a column the engine actually writes.**
 *    `StepInstance.executionTimeMs` is deliberately NOT used: `exitStep` writes
 *    it on the COMPLETED path only, while every FAILED path
 *    (`step-handler`, `activity-worker-handler`, `condition-handler`) sets
 *    `exitedAt` and leaves it null. A p95 over that column would silently be a
 *    success-only latency wearing the name of a step latency. Run duration is
 *    measured instead, from `startedAt` → the terminal timestamp, both of which
 *    the engine always writes.
 * 2. **Dry runs never count.** `WorkflowInstance.isDryRun` is the flag
 *    (spec §8.2: "excludes the instance from KPIs"); the caller filters on it
 *    and the shapes below carry only already-filtered rows.
 * 3. **A denominator is always reported next to a rate.** `successRate` without
 *    `runsTerminal` and `taskSlaHitRate` without `tasksWithDeadline` are both
 *    unreadable — 100% over one run is not the same claim as 100% over 4,000.
 * 4. **A run that tolerated a failure is not a success.** `successRate` counts
 *    the run's VERDICT, not its lifecycle status: a `partial_failure` reached
 *    END but did not do everything it was asked to. It is reported as its own
 *    number (`runsPartialFailure`) rather than folded into either bucket.
