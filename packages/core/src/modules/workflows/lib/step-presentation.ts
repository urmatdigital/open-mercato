/**
 * Step presentation model (spec `2026-07-30-workflow-run-outcomes.md`, Part 2) — PURE.
 *
 * The canvas used to paint the ENGINE's lifecycle vocabulary, which was built
 * for control flow rather than for reading. `WAITING_FOR_ACTIVITIES` means "the
 * executor handed work to a queue and will resume when it returns" — that is the
 * engine WORKING, and painting it as an amber pause was the single most
 * misleading thing on the run views.
 *
 * The rule this module encodes: **amber means blocked on the outside world. If
 * the system is doing work it is blue and it moves.**
 *
 * Derived, never stored. No new column, no new engine event: every input is
 * either a `StepInstance` row, a `WorkflowEvent` row, the instance status or the
 * engine-owned `metadata.attention` marker. `lib/run-execution.ts` collects the
 * evidence; this decides what it MEANS. No React, no ORM, no DI — the same rule
 * `lib/node-outcome-rows.ts` and `lib/breach-routing.ts` follow.
