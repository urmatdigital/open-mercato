/**
 * Every write that can move a project's logged minutes or cost travels as a
 * `staff.timesheets.time_entry.*` event, but not all of them by the same route:
 *
 *  - create / update / delete (soft) are emitted by the time-entry **commands**
 *    through `staffTimeEntryCrudEvents` (`lib/crud.ts`), which the CRUD route and
 *    `/copy-day` and `/[id]/duplicate` all drive;
 *  - `/bulk` emits the same config itself, once per changed row, because it writes
 *    through the EntityManager instead of the command bus;
 *  - the timer transitions emit `…timer_started` / `…timer_stopped` explicitly.
 *
 * All of those carry the `{ id, tenantId, organizationId }` payload this handler
 * needs. The batch-level members of the family — `…bulk_updated`, `…locked`,
 * `…unlocked` — deliberately carry no `id` and fall out at the guard below, because
 * the per-row events of the same write already covered every affected project.
 *
 * Subscribing to the family rather than three exact ids is what keeps a future write
 * path from silently skipping the budget check.
 *
 * `persistent: true`: this ends in a user-visible alert about money and hours
 * already spent. It has to survive a worker restart and be retried on failure — an
 * ephemeral subscription would drop the alert whenever the process handling the
 * entry write went away, and nothing would ever raise it again.
