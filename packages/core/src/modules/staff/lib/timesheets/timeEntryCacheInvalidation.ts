 * no `events` config), which singularizes the command's SECOND segment — so the tag
 * is `staff.timesheet`, NOT the `staff.time_entry` the entity name suggests. Deriving
 * it here through the same shared helpers keeps the flush tag equal to the store tag;
 * a hand-typed literal is how a custom write route silently flushes nothing (#3143,
 * #3711). The literal fallback only guards against a null derivation at runtime — the
 * unit test pins the derived value so drift fails in CI instead of in production.

/**
 * Flush the cached time-entry collections and record entries after a committed write.
 *
 * Custom write routes that mutate `StaffTimeEntry` through the EntityManager bypass
 * `makeCrudRoute`'s own POST/PUT/DELETE handlers and the command bus, so neither of
 * the platform's two `invalidateCrudCache` call sites runs for them. Without this the
 * opt-in CRUD list cache (`ENABLE_CRUD_API_CACHE`) keeps serving the pre-write payload
 * and the weekly timesheet grid reloads without the rows it just saved (#4970).
 *
 * MUST be called after the transaction commits, never inside it. Because the write is
 * already committed by then, a failing cache backend is logged rather than thrown — the
 * command bus guards its own invalidation the same way. Surfacing it would turn a
 * successful write into an error response and invite a duplicating client retry, while
 * swallowing it costs at most one TTL of staleness.
