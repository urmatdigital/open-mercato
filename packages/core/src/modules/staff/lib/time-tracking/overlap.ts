/**
 * EP-38 — the overlap policy provider.
 *
 * `findOverlaps` is unchanged: it still answers the arithmetic question "which
 * of these spans intersect the candidate". What is new is the policy layer on
 * top of it, which answers the product question "and what should happen".
 *
 * The built-in `staff.time_tracking.overlap.warn_when_enabled` reproduces
 * today's behaviour exactly, including the setting's off state: overlapping time
 * is legitimate in consulting work, so the answer is `warn` when the
 * `warnings.overlap` tenant setting is on and at least one span intersects, and
 * `allow` otherwise. It never returns `block`.
 *
 * Contributed policies can only ESCALATE — the combined answer is the most
 * severe of every policy's, `block` > `warn` > `allow` — so a payroll-compliance
 * module can harden the rule but nothing can silently suppress a warning the
 * tenant asked for.
