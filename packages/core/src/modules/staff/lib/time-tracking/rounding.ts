/**
 * EP-32 — the rounding strategy registry.
 *
 * `roundMinutes` is still the single rounding entry point every call site uses,
 * and with no contribution it runs the built-in `staff.time_tracking.rounding.unit`
 * strategy, which is the same `up`/`nearest` × `0|5|10|15` arithmetic this file
 * has always held. A contribution outranks it only when the call site supplies a
 * complete tenant + organization scope (`registries/scope.ts`), so an unscoped
 * client preview keeps producing the built-in's number.

 * The single rounding entry point, and the boundary a contributed strategy's answer

 *
 * The result is written straight into `staff_time_entries.rounded_minutes` — an
 * `integer` column, and the only input to every amount the suite computes — so an
 * unusable answer is clamped back to the built-in's rather than stored, and one
 * larger than the column can hold is capped at its ceiling rather than 500ing the
 * write. The built-in is exempt from the clamp on purpose: it is the arithmetic the
 * module shipped, it cannot produce a non-finite or fractional value, and re-shaping
 * its output would be the behaviour change the registries exist to avoid.
 *
 * A strategy that *threw* has already been logged and replaced by `runStrategy`, so
 * it returns the built-in directly instead of routing its `NaN` through the clamp,
 * which would log the same failure a second time under the wrong description.
