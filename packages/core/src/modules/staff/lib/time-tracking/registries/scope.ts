/**
 * The scope contract every time-tracking strategy resolver receives, and the
 * fail-closed rule the spec's cross-cutting requirements attach to it: a
 * contributed strategy runs only when the caller supplied BOTH a tenant and an
 * organization, matching `resolveProjectAccess` in `../access.ts`.
 *
 * A built-in never needs the scope — it is the same pure arithmetic the module
 * shipped before the registries existed — so failing closed lands on the
 * built-in rather than on an error. That is what makes a client preview
 * (`TimeEntryDialog`, `timeTrackingSettingsForm`, `ProjectCodeField`), which has
 * no tenant id to hand, keep producing exactly the number it produced before.
