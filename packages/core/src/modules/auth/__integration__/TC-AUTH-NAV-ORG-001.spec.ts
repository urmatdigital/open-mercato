/**
 * TC-AUTH-NAV-ORG-001: `GET /api/auth/admin/nav` reports the organization actually in scope.
 * Source spec: .ai/specs/2026-07-30-backend-chrome-current-organization.md ("Integration Coverage").
 *
 * Exercises `currentOrganization` through the real scope-resolution boundary rather than a mocked
 * one. That distinction matters: `resolveFeatureCheckContext`
 * (`modules/directory/utils/organizationScope.ts`) deliberately falls back to `auth.orgId` when
 * `scope.selectedId` is `null`, and `null` is exactly what the all-organizations selection produces.
 * A unit test that mocks the resolver can therefore "pass" while the real payload names the
 * caller's home organization during an all-organizations view — the opposite of the documented
 * contract.
 *
 * Verified-against-source contract (`modules/auth/api/admin/nav.ts`):
 * - the selection arrives as the `orgId` query parameter (`:113`), with `__all__`
 *   (`ALL_ORGANIZATIONS_COOKIE_VALUE`) meaning all organizations
 * - responses are cached under a key built from the *resolved* scope (`:141-142`), which is why the
 *   ordering assertions below matter: an all-organizations request and a home-organization request
 *   must not serve each other's payload

/**
 * The defect needs a caller that can select all organizations *and* whose token carries a home
 * organization — the fallback resolves to `auth.orgId`, so a caller without one would make these
 * assertions vacuous. `superadmin` can select both scopes; the concrete-selection test below proves
 * the resolver really can name an organization for this caller, which is what keeps the
 * all-organizations assertion meaningful.
