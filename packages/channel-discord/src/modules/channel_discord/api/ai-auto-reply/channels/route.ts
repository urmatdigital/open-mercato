/**
 * Every Discord channel's AI auto-reply state in one call.
 *
 * The integration detail panel needs two booleans and an agent id per channel.
 * Asking the per-channel settings route for them meant one request per channel
 * *and* one full agent-registry load per request — 41 requests and 40 registry
 * loads to render 40 rows on a page operators land on. Nothing about that panel
 * needs the agent directory, so this route does not build one.
 *
 * The path is pinned in `metadata` rather than inferred from the file location,
 * the way `api/interactions/route.ts` pins its own: the sibling settings route
 * lives under `channels/[id]/`, and a collection endpoint that reads as a channel
 * id (`/channels/ai-auto-reply`) is a URL waiting to be mistaken for one.

  // connecting a Discord bot writes `user_id = auth.sub` — the connect widget
  // posts to the per-user credentials route, and the tenant-wide route refuses
  // Discord outright — so a shared-only filter matched nothing that can exist
  // and the panel, the feature's only entry point, was always empty. The clause
  // mirrors `assertCanAccessChannel` exactly, so widening the listing does not
  // widen access: another operator's personal channel stays invisible, and the
  // per-channel settings route still runs its own `manage` guard before anything
  // can be armed.
  //
  // Both fragments can carry an `$or`, so they are nested under `$and` — spread
  // side by side, the second would silently overwrite the first. The ownership
  // clause is always present; the org fragment drops out for an unrestricted
  // caller, so `$and` never ends up empty.
