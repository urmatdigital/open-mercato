/**
 * TC-CHANNEL-DISCORD-011 — the AI auto-reply panel lists the Discord channels
 * operators actually have.
 * Source: https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato/issues/5602
 *
 * The panel on `/backend/integrations/channel_discord` is the ONLY entry point
 * to the per-channel AI auto-reply settings — no row action on the channels
 * list, no menu item — so an empty panel is an unreachable feature, not a
 * cosmetic gap. It filtered `userId: null` on the assumption that a Discord bot
 * channel is tenant-scoped. Nothing the product exposes can create such a
 * channel: the connect widget posts to the per-user credentials route, which
 * writes `user_id = auth.sub`, and the tenant-wide route refuses Discord
 * outright because the adapter declares no `channelScope`. So the filter matched
 * nothing that can exist, and `GET /api/channel_discord/ai-auto-reply/channels`
 * returned `{"items":[]}` on a tenant with working Discord bots.
 *
 * The two halves this pins, because fixing one by breaking the other is the easy
 * mistake here:
 *   1. a per-user Discord channel — the only kind there is — appears for its
 *      owner;
 *   2. it does NOT appear for anybody else, not even another admin. Personal
 *      channel privacy is strict owner-only (v1), and widening a listing must
 *      not be a way around it.
 *
 * Ceiling, stated rather than implied: a REAL Discord channel cannot be
 * connected in CI, because the adapter's `validateCredentials` performs a live
 * call against a bot token no test environment has. The fixture therefore
 * connects the network-free chat stub and relabels its `provider_key`. What that
 * does NOT stub is the thing that was broken — the row is a genuine
 * `communication_channels` row with a genuine `user_id`, produced by the real
 * connect command, and the route under test is the real one.
 *
 * Driven via the env-gated test-seed fixture (`OM_ENABLE_TEST_CHANNEL_SEEDING`);
 * skips when the gate is off.
