   * This is not a blanket "no credential travels on this payload" guarantee, and
   * reading it as one would be a mistake: `interaction.token` below IS a
   * credential. It is Discord's interaction webhook token, and on its own — with
   * no bot token at all — it can post as the application (the `auth === null`
   * calls in `discord-rest.ts`), so it does land on disk under the local
   * strategy. Discord expires it 15 minutes after the interaction, which bounds
   * the exposure rather than removing it. `interactions-dispatch.ts` states the
   * same constraint from the other side.
