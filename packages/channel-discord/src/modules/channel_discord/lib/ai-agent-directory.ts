 * `runAiAgentObject` requests execution mode `object`, and `checkAgentPolicy`
 * rejects an agent that is neither declared object-mode nor carrying an output
 * schema (`execution_mode_not_supported`). Offering a chat-mode agent in the
 * picker would therefore be offering a setting that can only ever fail at
 * runtime — the exact failure mode this feature was filed to remove.
 *
 * The import is dynamic and failure-tolerant because `@open-mercato/ai-assistant`
 * is an optional peer: a deployment without it gets `{ available: false }`, and
 * the settings surface then explains why auto-reply cannot be enabled instead of
 * rendering an empty dropdown.

 * this answers the *authorization* question the runtime asks next, when
 * `checkAgentPolicy` runs the agent's `requiredFeatures` against the principal
 * from `lib/ai-service-principal.ts`. An agent that clears the first and fails the
 * second stores a setting that can only fail later, inside a background
 * subscriber — the failure mode issue #4778 was filed for.
 *
 * The check delegates to the platform's own `authorizeFeatures`, one feature at a
 * time so the caller can name what is missing. Going through the shared helper —
 * rather than a `Set.has` — is what makes wildcard grants (`customers.*`, `*`),
 * removed features and disabled modules resolve exactly the way the runtime will
 * resolve them; a hand-rolled comparison would reject a bot user whose role
 * carries a wildcard and the operator would have no way to tell why.
