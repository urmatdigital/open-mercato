 * reads "Auto-reply on" while the channel answers nothing, and a `logger.warn` in
 * a background subscriber is not somewhere anyone looks. A save-time check cannot
 * close this on its own either — the settings route validates the agent against
 * the auto-reply principal, but a role edited afterwards makes that verdict stale.
 *
 * `failure: null` clears the marker, and the caller is expected to skip the write
 * when there is nothing to clear — a successful reply on a healthy channel must
 * not cost a row update per inbound message.
 *
 * The channel row's own `lastError` is deliberately left alone: the hub owns it
 * for delivery and polling failures, clears it on a successful poll, and keys the
 * reauth banner off `status`. Borrowing it here would let an AI failure mask a
 * delivery failure and let a successful poll erase an AI one.
