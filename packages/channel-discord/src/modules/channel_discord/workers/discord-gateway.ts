 * Long-running Discord Gateway bridge worker (SPEC 2026-06-19 § Gateway worker).
 *
 * This is a *provider-owned* long-running worker — a novel pattern relative to
 * the email providers (which are poll/push-driven by the hub). A worker file
 * under `workers/` is auto-discovered, so shipping one from a provider package is
 * allowed by the framework. `concurrency: 1` enforces the single-identify-per-bot
 * discipline Discord requires.
 *
 * The job opens one Gateway WebSocket per active `discord` channel and bridges
 * `MESSAGE_CREATE` / reaction events into the hub's existing queues (inbound +
 * reactions) — the same jobs the webhook route enqueues, so the hub stays
 * unchanged. Events the bot authored are dropped (feedback-loop guard); the hub
 * dedups the rest.
 *
 * Set `OM_CHANNEL_DISCORD_GATEWAY_DISABLED=1` to skip opening sockets (CI /
 * send-only deployments).
