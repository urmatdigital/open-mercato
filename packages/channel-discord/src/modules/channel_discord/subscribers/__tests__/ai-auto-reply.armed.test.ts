/**
 * Armed contract for the AI auto-reply subscriber (issue #4778).
 *
 * This test replaces the dormancy contract that shipped with #4391. That one
 * asserted the inverse — that NO product surface could arm the subscriber —
 * which was the honest statement while the feature was de-scoped. Now that the
 * feature is real, the property worth pinning is the opposite one, and it is
 * narrower: the two arming keys have exactly ONE writer, that writer is the
 * settings command, and the operator surface in front of it is gated on
 * `channel_discord.configure`.
 *
 * Structural assertions are worth having here because the properties they cover
 * are invisible to a behavioural test: a second writer that skipped the command
 * (and therefore the optimistic-lock check and the audit entry) would keep every
 * unit test green, and so would a `features: []` regression in the subscriber —
 * the exact defect the re-review of #4391 found.
