// A module's long-lived, process-wide runtime.
//
// Everything else a module contributes is either declarative (routes, ACL, entities) or runs per
// unit of work (a request, an event, a job). This is the one thing that is neither: something that
// must exist for as long as the process does — a worker loop, a broker subscription, a poller, a
// watcher.
//
// `di.ts` is the closest existing point and is the wrong one: a container is built per request in
// the web tier, so a runtime started there starts per request, or — with a module-scoped guard —
// on whichever request happens to arrive first, never on a replica that receives none.
//
// See .ai/specs/SPEC-072-2026-09-11-module-runtime-start-hook.md.
