 * double-ran exact-match persistent subscribers and never reached wildcard

 * persistent subscribers inline instead. That is no longer dual-dispatch: the
 * producer stamps the queued job with what it already delivered, so the worker
 * skips it. Either way a persistent emit runs its subscribers exactly once.
 *
 * The `mercato server` bootstrap may rewrite the env to `false` for a process it
 * knows runs no worker (see {@link reconcileSingleDelivery}). The bus does NOT
 * second-guess the flag itself: the queue is durable, so a persistent emit with
 * no worker yet is delayed, not lost, and a worker started later drains the
