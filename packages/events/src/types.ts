   * it and throws an actionable error when it is absent, so the fail-loud
   * behaviour does not depend on the type.
   *
   * Selects every subscriber whose registered pattern matches `event` and is
   * marked `persistent`, so wildcard (`event: '*'`) persistent subscribers are
   * reached. The selection does not depend on `OM_EVENTS_SINGLE_DELIVERY`:
   * whether inline delivery already ran is carried by the job's
   * `persistentDeliveredInline` stamp, so a producer and a worker that disagree
   * about the flag still agree about the job.

   *   `ctx.resolve`, so subscribers bind to the container that job runs in rather
   *   than the one that happened to build the bus. That distinction only bites
   *   under `OM_BOOTSTRAP_CACHE`, where the cached bus is replayed into later
   *   request containers while its captured resolver stays bound to the first —
   *   but the worker already holds the correct handle, so there is no reason to
   *   depend on the two coinciding.
