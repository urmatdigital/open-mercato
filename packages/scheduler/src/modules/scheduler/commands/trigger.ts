// =============================================================================
// Manual Schedule Trigger Command — Undo Policy
// =============================================================================
//
// `scheduler.jobs.trigger` is registered with `isUndoable: false` and defines no
// `undo`/`redo`. It mutates no domain state itself: it enqueues an execution job,
// and a worker picks that job up as soon as it is free. By the time an operator
// could reach for Undo the run has already started, and whatever it did is
// reversed through the action-log entries the run itself writes — the target
// command's own `undo`, or the target queue's domain-level counter-action.
//
// Minting an undo token here would therefore offer to reverse an enqueue that no
// longer exists, while leaving the run's real effects untouched. No `undo`
// handler also means no `undoToken`, hence no `x-om-operation` header — which is
// what `TC-UNDO-001 §4` pins.
//
// The command exists for the audit trail: manual triggering is an
// authorised-looking way to make an automated job run at a moment of the actor's
// choosing, so every authenticated attempt — refusals included — must leave an
// `ActionLog` row naming the caller. The one exception is bus-wide rather than
// local: `CommandBus.execute` throws `CommandInterceptorError` before `buildLog`
// and `persistLog` run, so an attempt a `before` interceptor blocks is refused
// without a row, exactly as it is for `scheduler.jobs.create`/`.update`/`.delete`.
