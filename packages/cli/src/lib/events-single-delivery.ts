// This guard is the ONLY place that reconciles the flag against worker
// availability. The event bus deliberately does not: the queue is durable, so a
// persistent emit with no worker yet is delayed rather than lost, and delivering
// inline instead would move the work onto the caller's request path. Only this
// bootstrap knows for a fact that the process it is launching runs no worker, so
// only it rewrites the value - into both envs below, so the app and any spawned
// child agree.

 * Server-bootstrap guard for the default-on single-delivery dispatch.

 * With single-delivery on, persistent subscribers are skipped inline and ONLY
 * the events worker dispatches them. A process that runs NO events worker
 * (auto-spawn off and no acknowledged external worker) would skip those
 * subscribers with nothing to drain the queue — silently dropping notifications,
 * queued emails, and indexing. This fails safe by disabling single-delivery for
 * such a process (persistent subscribers run inline instead) and returning a loud
 * warning. The bus stamps the queued job, so the inline run stays exactly-once.
 *
 * Transient worker downtime is NOT this guard's concern: the durable queue holds
 * the job until a worker returns. Only the "no worker at all" config is guarded.
