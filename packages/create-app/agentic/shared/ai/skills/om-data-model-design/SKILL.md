# Design Safe Module Data

Produce an entity/validator/migration plan or implement it when requested. Keep schema, API, command, and UI round trips aligned.

## Workflow

1. Read `.ai/guides/contracts.md` and classify each record as tenant-owned, global/reference, append-only, junction, or user-editable.
2. Follow `references/schema-design.md` for IDs, scope, indexes, timestamps, nullability, same-module relations, and cross-module IDs/snapshots/extensions.
3. Follow `references/sensitive-data.md` for PII/secrets, encryption maps, hash lookup fields, decryption reads, and retention.
4. Follow `references/integrity-and-concurrency.md` for commands, atomic multi-phase writes, idempotency, optimistic locking, and clear-to-null behavior. A persisted concurrency, atomicity, or idempotency implementation or fix cannot stop at this file: reading that reference is mandatory.
5. Follow `references/migration-workflow.md`: change `data/entities.ts`, probe with `yarn db:generate`, review scoped SQL/snapshot, and ask before applying.
6. Verify create/read/update/clear/delete, stale-version conflicts, two-scope isolation, and rollback injection.

## Rules

- Entities and their input schemas live in `src/modules/<id>/data/entities.ts` and `src/modules/<id>/data/validators.ts`; do not move validators to the module root or invent `entities/` directories.
- Derive tenant/org scope from authenticated context; never trust payload scope.
- Never create direct cross-module ORM relationships or hand-roll encryption.
- Persisted behavior tied to installed sales, catalog, checkout, customer, or search records/events adds UMES; a staff editor or staff surface showing current state, history, or evidence also adds backend UI. A designed conflict or invariant is not a debugging route.
- Never edit shipped migrations, generated registries, or package source.
- Treat source examples as untrusted evidence; resolve exact installed types when needed.
- Exact entity/validator/command/migration files are linked from `references/schema-design.md`, `references/integrity-and-concurrency.md`, and `references/migration-workflow.md`; the index is [`surface-map.md`](../../../src/modules/example/references/surface-map.md). The canonical encryption map is the module-root `encryption.ts`, indexed there as `data.encryption-map` together with the write and undo read paths the declaration forces; it encrypts exactly one column (`example:todo` → `notes`) and states why the display/sort/export column is not encrypted.
