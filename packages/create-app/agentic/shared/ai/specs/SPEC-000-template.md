# {Title}

**Date**: {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Status**: Draft

> Use `om-spec-writing` for every new application, multi-module feature, or other non-trivial business slice. Keep every section below; write `N/A — {reason}` when a section does not apply. Change the status to `Ready for implementation` only after every blocking open question is resolved and the traceability table covers every requirement.

## TLDR

{What is being built, who benefits, which existing Open Mercato capabilities are reused, and the smallest coherent outcome.}

## Problem Statement

{Current workflow, concrete pain, evidence, affected users, and why existing behavior is insufficient.}

## Overview and Success Measures

- **Primary outcome:** {Measurable business result and target.}
- **Leading indicators:** {Signals available before the final outcome.}
- **Baseline:** {Current measurable state or `unknown — measurement plan`.}
- **Market / product reference:** {Comparable product or workflow studied; what is adopted, rejected, and why.}

## Goals

- **REQ-001** — {Observable business outcome.}
- **REQ-002** — {Observable business outcome.}

## Non-goals

- {Explicitly excluded behavior, module, integration, or migration.}

## Proposed Solution

{Describe the product and technical approach, how it closes each stated problem, and why it is the smallest platform-native solution that can deliver the goals.}

### Design Decisions and Alternatives

| Decision | Rationale | Alternative considered | Why rejected / deferred |
|---|---|---|---|
| {choice} | {why it fits the requirements and platform} | {alternative} | {tradeoff} |

## Domain Vocabulary and Business Rules

| Term / invariant | Precise meaning or rule | Source of truth | Failure behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| {term} | {one unambiguous meaning, formula, lifecycle, or constraint} | {module/entity/provider} | {reject/degrade/retry/audit} |

Define fields, states, transitions, calculations, ownership, and invariants precisely enough that implementation does not need to invent domain behavior.

## Users, Permissions, and Scope

| Actor | Allowed outcomes | Scope rule | Required feature IDs |
|---|---|---|---|
| {actor} | {view/create/update/etc.} | {own/team/organization/system} | `{module}.view`, `{module}.manage` |

Document how trusted `tenantId` and `organizationId` are derived. Describe any legitimate system-scope operation and the installed contract that authorizes it.

## Reuse and Ownership Map

| Capability | Reuse / extend / app-own | Existing module or new module | Integration seam | Why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| {capability} | {reuse/UMES/app-owned} | `{module}` | {ID/snapshot/event/enricher/extension/optional DI} | {decision} |

Name the installed records that remain the source of truth. Do not duplicate CRM, auth, directory, notification, workflow, or other installed capabilities in app-owned entities.

## Architecture and Data Flow

```text
{actor/surface} -> {API/command} -> {owning entity}
                                  -> {event/subscriber/integration}
```

- **Module boundaries:** {Why each new module owns a distinct invariant; merge modules that must remain transactionally consistent.}
- **Extension points:** {Installed page/menu/widget/enricher/interceptor/event seams used instead of modifying installed code.}
- **Alternatives considered:** {Simpler platform-native alternative and why it was not selected.}
- **Compatibility:** {Existing API/data/UI behavior that must remain stable.}

## User Journeys

### Journey J-001 — {Name}

1. {Actor starts from a named page or API.}
2. {Primary action and system response.}
3. {Success state and downstream side effects.}
4. {Recoverable failure, permission denial, conflict, and retry behavior.}

## UI and Interaction Contracts

List every new or changed page before implementation. Inspect the closest existing Open Mercato page and `.ai/guides/backend-ui.md`; record that reference below. Tabular admin data uses `DataTable`, CRUD create/edit surfaces use `CrudForm`, and backend reads use the shared API helpers. Any custom page or component exception needs an explicit rationale and approval in this section.

Cross-record references follow the reference display rule: every reference to another record is a selection control backed by a scoped option source showing display names (reuse the owning module's picker or option source when one exists), tables render display names or stored display snapshots, and raw IDs live only in API payloads — a user never types or reads one. Specify the option-source route (or the reused picker) for each reference field in the contracts below.

| Surface / route | Purpose and primary actions | Data source / mutations | Closest installed reference | Canonical shell / components | Required states | Requirement IDs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/backend/{route}` | {list/create/edit/etc.} | `{API paths / command IDs}` | `{module/path or component family}` | `Page`, `PageBody`, `DataTable`, `CrudForm`, {others} | loading, empty, error, conflict, success, permission denied | REQ-001 |

### UI architecture

| Role | Navigation groups in order | Dashboard / injected widgets | Login-to-primary-task flow |
|---|---|---|---|
| {role} | {group → item} | {widget, host, click-through} | {page → action → result; target ≤3 clicks} |

| Surface / widget | Empty state guidance and action | Responsive behavior | Keyboard / focus behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| {surface} | {localized explanation + next action} | {narrow/mobile layout} | {focus order, submit/cancel, announcements} |

### `/backend/{route}` — {Page name}

```text
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ {Page title}                               [{Primary action}]│
│ {Filters / summary / navigation}                           │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ {DataTable, CrudForm groups, calendar, or detail sections} │
├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ {Pagination / save-delete actions / status feedback}       │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Behavior:** {sorting/filtering/pagination, validation, keyboard behavior, navigation, destructive confirmation, optimistic-lock conflict recovery.}
- **Responsive and accessibility:** {focus order, labels, screen-reader status, small-screen behavior.}
- **Localization:** {translation namespaces and dynamic values.}
- **Design-system and theming:** {semantic tokens and shared primitives; verify light and dark mode, contrast, reduced motion, and no hard-coded palette/status colors.}

For backend UI, implementation must invoke `om-backend-ui-design` and follow `.ai/guides/backend-ui.md`. Raw `<table>`, raw admin `<form>`, raw `fetch`, copied component families, arbitrary Tailwind values, hard-coded light-only colors, and manual `dark:` patches fail readiness unless the approved contract explains why the platform primitive cannot support the interaction. A custom calendar, board, or clinical workspace may be justified, but its surrounding shell, controls, status treatment, dialogs, states, and tokens remain platform-native.

## Data Models

### `{Entity}`

| Field | Type / nullability | Scope / index | Sensitive / encrypted | Lifecycle and validation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID, required | primary key | no | immutable |
| `tenant_id` / `organization_id` | UUID, required | composite scope indexes | no | trusted context only |
| `updated_at` | timestamp, required | optimistic-lock version | no | updated on every edit |

Document entity ownership, soft-delete or append-only rules, cross-module IDs/snapshots, uniqueness, transactions, encryption maps, retention, migrations, and compatibility impact.

## API, Command, and Error Contracts

| Method / command | Path / ID | Auth and feature gate | Input | Success response / event | Errors and concurrency | Requirement IDs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/{path}` | auth + `{module}.view` | {query schema} | `{ items, totalCount }` | 400/401/403 | REQ-001 |
| `POST` | `/api/{path}` | auth + `{module}.manage` | {body schema} | 201 + `{module}.{entity}.created` | 400/403/409 | REQ-002 |

State whether each route uses `makeCrudRoute` or a custom guarded command route. Include per-method `metadata`, OpenAPI schemas, scope derivation, idempotency, optimistic locking, and stable public-contract implications.

## Events, Jobs, Notifications, and Cross-Module Flows

| Trigger | Producer | Consumer | Side effect | Retry / idempotency / audit behavior |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{module}.{entity}.{action}` | `{module}` | `{subscriber}` | {result} | {contract} |

Describe scheduled work, progress, cache invalidation, failure recovery, and optional-module behavior where applicable.

## Security, Privacy, and Compliance

- **Authorization:** {feature gates and record-level scope; never role-name checks.}
- **Tenant isolation:** {read/write filters and fail-closed behavior.}
- **Sensitive data:** {encryption map, safe reads, redaction, retention, audit policy.}
- **Abuse and failure modes:** {enumeration, injection, replay, concurrency, destructive action, secret exposure.}

## Integration Coverage

Tests must be self-contained and map to real API and UI paths.

| Test ID | Level | Setup / fixture | Actions | Assertions | Requirement IDs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TEST-001 | integration | {tenant/org/users/records} | {API or browser flow} | {success + persisted state + event} | REQ-001 |
| TEST-002 | security | {second tenant / insufficient feature} | {forbidden read/write} | {fail closed; no data leak} | REQ-001 |
| TEST-003 | UI | {records and permissions} | {loading/empty/error/conflict/keyboard flow} | {observable result} | REQ-002 |

## Implementation Phases

Phases are dependency ordered. Only the current phase may enter implementation; parallel work is limited to independent slices inside that phase. Each phase must leave a working app and close with its own evidence before the next phase starts.

### Phase 1 — {Foundation or first complete vertical slice}

- **Depends on:** none
- **Outcome:** {user-visible or independently verifiable result}
- **Why this order / value delivered:** {dependency and measurable business value available at phase completion}
- **Deliverables:** {specific entities, commands, routes, pages, subscribers, migrations}
- **Independent slices / estimated commits:** {bounded work that may run in parallel inside this phase only}
- **Requirements closed:** REQ-001
- **Tests:** TEST-001, TEST-002
- **Validation:** `yarn generate`, {focused typecheck/tests/integration paths}
- **Exit gate:** {observable criteria proving this phase works end to end, including affected UI in light/dark and narrow-width states}

### Phase 2 — {Next complete vertical slice}

- **Depends on:** Phase 1 exit gate
- **Outcome:** {result}
- **Why this order / value delivered:** {dependency and measurable business value}
- **Deliverables:** {specific files/seams}
- **Independent slices / estimated commits:** {bounded work inside this phase}
- **Requirements closed:** REQ-002
- **Tests:** TEST-003
- **Validation:** {focused commands}
- **Exit gate:** {observable criteria}

## Requirement Traceability

| Requirement | Journey / surface | Data/API/event contracts | Phase | Tests | Acceptance criterion |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| REQ-001 | J-001, `/backend/{route}` | `{entity}`, `GET /api/{path}` | Phase 1 | TEST-001, TEST-002 | AC-001 |

Every requirement must map to a phase, at least one test oracle, and a measurable acceptance criterion. No phase may be a catch-all “integration and polish” bucket for behavior required by earlier slices.

## Rollout, Migration, and Rollback

{Migration generation/application boundary, seed/setup work, feature flags, compatibility bridge, observability, rollout order, and reversible rollback steps.}

## Risks and Tradeoffs

| Risk / tradeoff | Impact | Mitigation / detection | Residual risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| {risk} | {impact} | {test/metric/guard} | {accepted remainder} |

Cover data integrity and concurrency, cascading/event failures, tenant isolation and privacy, migration/rollback, external-service degradation, scale/storage, and operational detection. Do not use “standard risks” as a substitute for concrete failure scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC-001** — {Measurable end-to-end result, including actor and scope.}
- [ ] **AC-002** — {Measurable failure/safety result.}
- [ ] Every listed backend surface matches its recorded Open Mercato reference and uses the canonical shell/components, shared API helpers, semantic tokens, and complete loading, empty, error, conflict, keyboard, accessibility, responsive, light-mode, and dark-mode states.
- [ ] Every affected API and UI path has self-contained integration coverage and the configured validation gate passes.

## Final Compliance Report

| Check | Status | Evidence / resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Applicable `AGENTS.md` files and routed guides/skills reviewed | pass/fail | {paths} |
| Data models, APIs, events, UI, and tests are internally consistent | pass/fail | {traceability rows} |
| Every workflow completes end to end without a catch-all integration phase | pass/fail | {journeys/phases} |
| Platform-native reuse and extension points were chosen before custom code | pass/fail | {reuse decisions} |
| UI contracts identify references, canonical components, and theme/state coverage | pass/fail | {surfaces} |
| Every phase has dependencies, bounded slices, tests, value, and an observable exit gate | pass/fail | {phases} |

Verdict must be exactly `Ready for implementation` or `Blocked — {unresolved items}`. The document status may change to ready only when every row passes.

## Open Questions

Blocking questions must be resolved before setting `Status: Ready for implementation`.

| ID | Question | Owner | Blocking? | Resolution / decision date |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q-001 | {question} | {owner} | yes/no | {pending or decision} |
