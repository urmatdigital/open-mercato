/**
 * Record validation-gate outcomes, and refuse to conclude on unverified source changes.
 *
 * Two modes, mirroring `entity-migration-check`'s shape:
 *
 * - `record` (PostToolUse on Bash) — when a Bash command was a validation gate AND its exit
 *   status genuinely belongs to that gate, append the status to `.ai/.gate-state.json`.
 * - `check` (Stop) — block when a file under `src/` changed after the session started and is
 *   newer than the last exit-0 typecheck, unless this stop is already the result of a block.
 *
 * Why this exists: a gate that is claimed but never run is indistinguishable, in a
 * transcript, from one that passed. This makes the difference mechanical.
 *
 * Deliberate limits. The blocker only considers `typecheck`: demanding a green `build` on
 * every stop would be punitive, and typecheck is the cheap gate that catches the defect class
 * this guards. It compares mtimes rather than hashing, so a touch-without-edit costs one
 * gate run. It blocks at most once per stop sequence, so a gate that genuinely cannot pass
 * is reported to the user rather than trapping the agent. And the state file can simply be
 * deleted — this is a speed bump against carelessness, not a defense against deliberate
 * circumvention.
